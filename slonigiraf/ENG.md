## Annotation <!-- omit from toc -->

We explore how education affects economic growth and present an education model that aims to outperform current models threefold. The model seeks to increase the number of acquired skills and has been implemented in several secondary schools with reported success. Our educational approach emphasizes peer-to-peer learning and addresses issues commonly encountered in this method. The model is expected to positively impact the world economy, potentially adding 8 trillion USD to the world economy each year. We also explore how private enterprises can expand the proposed educational model globally while profitably benefiting from this reform.

## Several Educational Models Are Known to Date

The most widely used educational model in the world is the **traditional model**, also known as "didactic" approach. This model is characterized by a teacher-centered approach, where the teacher is the primary source of information and the focus is on rote learning and memorization. It is the oldest and most prevalent model of education, and is still used in many schools around the world.

In this model, the teacher is responsible for delivering information to the students, and students are expected to memorize and regurgitate that information on exams and assessments. The curriculum is based on textbooks, lectures, and direct instruction, and there is a strong emphasis on standardized testing and assessments.

This model is still widely used in many countries, particularly in developing countries and in some parts of the developed world, but it has been criticized for not providing students with the critical thinking and problem-solving skills they need to be successful in the modern world. As a result, there have been increasing calls for the adoption of more student-centered, interactive and creative educational models that help to develop the whole person.

There are many other education models that have been developed and implemented over time, some of the most well-known include:

**Montessori**: Developed by Maria Montessori, this model emphasizes a child-centered approach, with an emphasis on self-directed learning and hands-on activities.

**Waldorf**: This model, developed by Rudolf Steiner, emphasizes a holistic approach to education, with a strong emphasis on the arts, practical skills, and a strong connection to nature.

**Reggio Emilia**: This Italian model is characterized by a project-based approach, where children learn through exploration, discovery and collaboration.

**Homeschooling**: This model of education is when the parents or guardians provide the education to the child at home.

**Online learning**: This model of education is when the students learn through internet-based platforms, it can be synchronous or asynchronous.

**Peer-to-peer learning**, also known as P2P learning, is an educational model in which students learn from and with each other, rather than from a teacher or instructor. In a peer-to-peer learning environment, students take on active roles as both learners and teachers, working together to share knowledge, skills, and resources.

**Private tutoring** is an educational model in which a student receives one-on-one instruction from a tutor outside of a traditional classroom setting. The tutor can be a certified teacher, a retired teacher or a subject matter expert. The tutor and student typically meet on a regular basis, either in person or online, to work on specific subjects or skills. Private tutoring can be costly and not accessible to everyone. It also requires a high level of commitment and responsibility from both the student and the tutor in order to be successful.

Each model has its own strengths and weaknesses, and the effectiveness of a model can depend on factors such as the context in which it is implemented and the specific implementation of the model.

## The Traditional Model Is the Most Efficient Among the Known Alternatives

Education plays a vital role in the world economy. [On average, education comprises](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SE.XPD.TOTL.GD.ZS) 4.2% of GDP - final goods and services produced and sold in a specific time period by countries. If the quality of education were to be improved threefold, it could potentially add approximately 8 (eight) trillion USD, or 8.4% of the global GDP, to the world economy each year with such effect size from the first year of an educational reform.

[PISA](https://www.oecd.org/pisa/test/) (Programme for International Student Assessment) is a standardized test that measures the performance of 15-year-old students in reading, mathematics, and science in countries around the world. The test is administered by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and is widely considered to be a benchmark for evaluating the quality of education systems. Countries that consistently score high on PISA tests are often considered to have strong education models.

The most recent PISA results, from 2018, indicate that Chinese students had the highest scores in all three subjects tested: mathematics, science, and reading.

The educational system in China can be characterized as traditional or didactic, which is a teaching method that is teacher-centered and emphasizes the transmission of information from the teacher to the student. In this method, the teacher is the primary source of knowledge and students are expected to listen, take notes, and memorize the information presented to them.

Therefore, it can be inferred that any proposed educational model that aims to be widely adopted should be more efficient and cost-effective per student than the traditional model.

While PISA test is useful for comparing educational systems between countries and identifying the most successful models, it is not intended for regular use in determining a model that outperforms the traditional one.

Another way to measure the efficiency of an education model on daily basis is by determining the average number of skills acquired by a group of students, divided by the total number of skills they were expected to acquire. [Traditional education typically has an efficiency](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10643-022-01332-3) of about 25%, while using [private tutoring the efficiency](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21574747/) can be increased up to 75%. However, private tutoring can be costly and requires a large number of educators. Peer learning, where students tutor each other, [does not outperform](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23691355/) the traditional education because of [two main challenges](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01443410500345172): the lack of motivation to teach among students and quality erosion due to "the broken telephone effect."

To address these issues, we propose using money to incentivize students to serve as tutors and require them to use a recommendation letter system to ensure the quality of such lessons. We have implemented this approach in several schools and observed an increase in education efficiency up to 75%, with students having ample time for both learning and teaching within their existing secondary education programs.

## Slonigiraf Is a New Educational Model More Efficient Than the Traditional

<img alt="Image" src="https://github.com/slonigiraf/slon-whitepaper/blob/main/img/lesson.png?raw=true" width="500">

*Figure 1. The proposed educational model is named "Slonigiraf". It consists of peer-to-peer tutoring (leftmost pane), expert selection (middle pane) and diplomas verification (last pane).*

### Students Pay Each Other for Issuance of Diplomas After Successful Tutoring

**The Slonigiraf lesson** does not include a traditional lecture component. Instead, it begins with students working in pairs. Students have the option to act as a tutor for a specific skill or as a tutee. Tutees have the freedom to choose their own tutors based on personal preference. **Tutors are typically peers of the tutees**, who have previously acquired the same knowledge through self-study or other means. A tutor, in the case that their tutee masters the skill, charges him **tuition fees** and **provide a diploma** certifying the acquired skill. If the student does not acquire the skill, the tutor receives nothing.

Each diploma is a unique electronic document that can be invalidated at any time if **an expert** determines that the holder does not possess the skill. The expert will be reimbursed for identifying a fake diploma, with the reimbursement paid by the tutor who issued the diploma. The amount of reimbursement is specified at the time of diploma issuance. As such, each diploma includes information on the trained skill, the tutor, the holder, and the potential **reimbursement** amount.

At the start of a lesson, there are frequently multiple tutors for a skill as they may have self-studied or learned it from their parents or prior tutelage. As a result, the lesson begins with multiple tutor-student pairs.

Let's examine how a lesson proceeds when there is only one tutor present. In Figure 1, the tutor is denoted as "A" in the leftmost panel. The tutor chooses a student who offered the highest amount of money or based on any other criteria of their choosing. This session is marked as "session 1" in Figure 1. After this session, the student may then become a tutor themselves. Then, these two tutors can teach the skill to two more students. This process is called "session 2." Each session doubles the number of tutors. After session 1, there are 2 students with diplomas, after session 2, there are 4, and after session 3, there are 16. This can be succinctly stated as follows:

$2^{sessions} = diplomas$

As an example: $2^{5} = 32$, meaning that after 5 sessions, 32 students will have acquired the skill. But, what if the lesson takes place in a university setting and the goal is to teach 512 students? Using the formula above, we can determine the number of sessions required by solving for $x$ in the equation: $2^{x} = 512$. By using a simple internet search or logarithm, we can find that $x=9$. Therefore, only 9 sessions are needed to teach 512 individuals the skill.

### Tutors Have Different Numbers of Tutees

<img alt="Image" src="https://github.com/slonigiraf/slon-whitepaper/blob/main/img/tutees_count.png?raw=true" width="500">

*Figure 2. A student may have varying amounts of mentees. For instance, in a class of 32 students, the maximum number of mentees per student would likely not exceed 5, given that the number of mentors doubles in each session.*

To estimate what tutor roles student can play in the Slonigiraf educational model and what are probabilities of playing such roles let's examine a class consisting of 32 students. We will explain later why probabilities of different roles are more of less the same in any student group size.

**Tutor of 0 tutees role**: as shown on a Fig. 2. a half of students (16 from 32) gains a skill in a last session. That means they will pay for tutoring and getting a diploma but will not earn money by tutoring such skill as there will be no students left who need the skill. If the class consists of 32 students there will be 16 such students (depicted with a digit "0" on a fig. 2).

**Tutor of 1 tutees role**: $1/4$ of students (8 from 32) gain a skill in a preterminal session. These students have 1 tutor and 1 tutee each, resulting in a net profit of zero as the money earned from being a tutor compensates for the money spent on being tutored.

**Tutor of 2 tutees role**: $1/8$ of students (4 from 32) have 2 tutees.

**Tutor of 3 tutees role**: $1/16$ of students (2 from 32) have 3 tutees.

**Tutor of 4 tutees role**: $1/32$ of students (1 from 32) have 4 tutees.

**Tutor of 5 tutees role**: $1/32$ of students (1 from 32) have 5 tutees.

As the number of mentees increases, the probability of taking on such a role decreases significantly. We will not delve into the probability of having more than 5 mentees in larger classes, as the chances of such roles are minimal and would not significantly impact the calculations of our model economy.

Increasing class size has little effect on the probabilities of different roles. For instance, in a class of 64 students, half of the students will take on the role of "tutor of 0 tutees", which is the same probability as in a class of 32 students. This suggests that our estimations of role probabilities are generally accurate.

All students have a tutor as all are required to obtain a diploma. The student with 5 tutees may receive their diploma by communicating with a tutor outside the group, such as a teacher or parent. As previously discussed, it is permitted to be a tutor without a diploma in the relevant skill, however, this increases the risk of failure, so students typically choose to first study the skill, obtain the diploma, and then teach others.

### Each Tutoring Interaction Is Focused on a Specific Skill

An important aspect of pedagogy is the structure and objectives of lessons, as well as the expected outcome. However, in traditional education, there is no guarantee that teachers will have a well-defined plan or clear learning objectives for their students each lesson. Allowing students to provide tutoring to their peers may exacerbate the problem as none of these student-mentors have received formal training in pedagogy.

We have implemented a simple solution for this problem. In this approach, every tutoring interaction focuses on only one skill per interaction. Tutors can easily access a method for teaching the skill from a database recommended by the teacher. Once the tutor determines that the student has mastered the skill, they can award a diploma that is specific to that skill. By using this approach, we can ensure that each tutoring interaction is focused on a specific skill and that the tutor understands the objectives of the interaction.

### Tutors Use a Simple Teaching Algorithm

As previously stated, teachers recommend tutors to use a database containing records on how to teach each skill. To make the work of tutors easier, we recommend that the teaching algorithm used is always the same. Only the skill being taught varies, but the teaching algorithm remains consistent, as shown in Figure 3.

The first step in the algorithm is to formulate a problem which the skill is meant to solve. For example, if we want to teach a student to add numbers, the problem can be formulated as: "What is the result of adding 2 and 3?" To ensure that the tutee understands the problem correctly, the tutor asks him/her to rephrase the problem and waits until the tutee responds with something like: "What is the result of adding 4 and 2?"

The next step is to determine if the tutee can identify and correct errors in problem-solving. The tutor answers a problem formulated by the tutee incorrectly. For example: "The result of adding 4 and 2 is 3. Am I right?" If the tutee fails to detect and correct the error, the tutor provides the correct answer: "The result of adding 4 and 2 is 6. Repeat." After the tutee repeats the answer, the tutor asks him/her to formulate another similar problem.

When the tutee starts to identify and correct errors in the tutor's answers, the tutor asks him/her to come back the next day to work on this skill to ensure that the skill is ingrained in long-term memory. On the next day, the tutor starts from the beginning of the algorithm. If the student immediately corrects the tutor's error, the tutor awards the tutee a diploma for the skill studied and receives payment for teaching and issuing the diploma. If the tutee is not able to correct the error immediately, the tutor continues working through the algorithm until the tutee is able to identify and correct errors and asks the tutee to come back the next day.

*Figure 3. A simple pedagogical algorithm that can be used by tutors to ensure the quality of the skill training.*

The pedagogical roots of such an algorithm can be traced back to the concept of error correction and feedback in learning. The algorithm is based on the idea that students learn best when they are actively engaged in the learning process and when they receive immediate feedback on their performance.

One of the main principles of this algorithm is to provide the tutee with a problem to solve, and then to ask them to rephrase the problem in order to ensure that they have understood it correctly. This is a key aspect of the "mastery learning" approach, which emphasizes the importance of ensuring that students understand and master a skill before moving on to the next one.

Another key aspect of this algorithm is the focus on error correction. By providing the tutee with an incorrect answer and then asking them to identify and correct the error, the tutor is providing them with an opportunity to practice the skill and to receive immediate feedback on their performance. This is in line with the "formative assessment" approach, which emphasizes the importance of ongoing assessment and feedback throughout the learning process.

Finally, the algorithm is based on the principle of spaced repetition, which is widely accepted as an effective way to promote long-term retention of information. By scheduling follow-up sessions and reviewing the same material multiple times, the algorithm aims to help the tutee to internalize the skill and to make it a permanent part of their knowledge base.

In summary, the algorithm is based on pedagogical principles such as mastery learning, formative assessment, and spaced repetition, which are known to be effective in promoting skill acquisition and retention.

### Some Students Become Experts

Holding a diploma does not necessarily mean that a student has fully mastered the skill in question. It simply indicates that the tutor believes they have. However, there are several reasons why this belief may be misguided. For example, the tutor may not possess the skill themselves, may not have adequately assessed the student's proficiency, or the student may have forgotten the skill. To ensure the quality of education, our model employs experts who verify diplomas and have the authority to award students with "A" grades or other types of reward. The primary expert at the start of a lesson is the master teacher who leads and manages the lesson. However, due to time constraints, they may not be able to verify all diplomas. The teacher can delegate this responsibility to select students who have already obtained a diploma in the skill being taught. The teacher will first verify that these students possess the skill. If they fail the verification, the teacher will hold the original tutor accountable. Those who pass the verification will take on **the role of experts** and get a reward from the teacher.

### Experts Earn Money Through Identification of Low-Quality Skills

Why do students want to become experts? The expert status enables them to verify a large number of diplomas and potentially identify ones that are not of high quality, resulting in reimbursement from the instructors who issued such diplomas. However, to prevent experts from falsely identifying all diplomas as low-quality in order to receive more rewards, students are allowed to choose which expert they want to work with. This creates competition among experts and promotes honesty.

The teacher is also able to re-verify diplomas that have already been verified by an expert if they suspect any cheating, such as the expert verifying a diploma that they themselves issued. In the event of cheating, the teacher can prohibit the student from being an expert for a certain period of time, and also receive reimbursement from the instructor who issued the diploma used in the cheating.

### A Tutee Can Allow a Tutor to Review a Diploma Issued by Another Tutor

Skills that are acquired but not used are prone to be forgotten. To combat this, many educational systems rely on repetition. The Slonigiraf educational model utilizes repetition in three ways. Firstly, by allowing students who have acquired a skill to teach it to other students. In this way, the student reinforces their understanding of the skill by teaching it to others. Secondly, our system uses repetition through expert verification of diplomas. And thirdly, tutors can work with their students to verify previous diplomas issued by other tutors. If a skill has been forgotten, the tutor who identifies the problem receives reimbursement from the tutor who issued the diploma, in the same way as an expert. This process is beneficial for both the current tutor, as they potentially receive reimbursement, and for the student, as they receive information about their current educational problems.

It is possible that a student and a tutor may conspire against a previous tutor to receive reimbursement while the student has not actually forgotten the skill. This type of deception is not prohibited in any administrative way, but it is almost impossible in the long term - such a student would be banned from the community of tutors as dishonest and would lose the ability to receive new diplomas.

### Teacher Salary Can Be Adjusted to the Quality of Teaching

**The role of a teacher** differs from that of a student in three ways:

- They are adults with pedagogical education
- They automatically play the role of an expert
- They have the authority to allow students to become experts

This allows for two different models of teacher salary calculation. The first is a more traditional approach, where the teacher receives a salary from the school budget. This model is likely to be more prevalent during the transition from traditional education to the Slonigiraf model. Under this option, the teacher does not receive any additional pay for tutoring or issuing diplomas. They teach 1-2 students for free and these students then spread the skill to other students for a fee. However, the teacher is still able to receive reimbursement from mentors in the same way as any expert, but the money received is added to the school budget and distributed among all students on an equal basis every month.

The second approach is more market-oriented, where the teacher does not receive any salary from the school budget. Instead, they are allowed to earn money both as a mentor and as an expert. The money that was allocated in the school budget for the teacher's salary is instead distributed among students on an equal basis every month.

### Linking Education to the Real World by Paying Students for Learning

The initial phase of transitioning to the new educational system involves replacing traditional lectures with peer-to-peer tutoring and the issuance of diplomas. This change can be implemented smoothly as it does not affect the salary of teachers and reduces their workload. As the reward, students will get "A" grades as in the usual educational system. These grades can be viewed as a form of payment for the opportunity to review their diplomas.

However, like any other educational approach, this system faces the challenge of not being directly linked to the real economy and job market. To address this issue, the next step is to pay students not with grades, but with actual money. This would involve educational organizations purchasing the option to review students' diplomas. This approach aims to regulate educational content through the market mechanism of supply and demand. This stage also results in dividing the teacher's salary into two parts: the fixed salary they receive from the educational organization and the payment they receive from students for serving as tutors and experts.

The idea of paying students for their education may raise ethical concerns, as the traditional view is that education is valuable in and of itself. However, it is essential to acknowledge that all nations invest in education because it ultimately leads to greater economic growth in the long term. Therefore, students who are actively engaged in their studies are contributing to this process and should be compensated for their efforts.

### Comparing the speed of skill acquisition of the Slonigiraf model to the traditional model

In the traditional model, a teacher teaches a group of students all at once, typically spending 22 minutes of their time to teach a skill to the group. The outcome of this method is that only one out of four students will have learned the skill. For example, if a teacher is working with a group of 32 students, this approach will result in 8 students having learned the skill.

In contrast, the Slonigiraf model utilizes individualized instruction, where a teacher works with students one-on-one. At first glance, it may appear that the traditional model results in more skills being acquired in the same amount of time. However, in 22 minutes, a teacher using the Slonigiraf model will be able to teach 2 students (11 minutes per student) and the first student taught by the teacher will then teach another student. This results in a total of 3 students acquiring the skill, whereas another teacher using a traditional model in the same amount of time would have taught 8 students.

But why are we arguing that the Slonigiraf model is more efficient than the traditional? The answer is because of other skills and other students. It's true that during 22 minutes only 3 students will get the skill that the teacher has started to introduce to the group. But during the time these 3 students acquire such skill other students will spread the skills that were introduced before. As any student in the Slonigiraf model has the 0.5 probability to get a new skill per session, during 2 sessions of 11 minutes each student is supposed to learn some new skill. Therefore, it is important to compare not just the number of students who acquire a specific skill in the traditional model (8) versus the Slonigiraf model (3), but also the total number of students who acquire any new skill in the Slonigiraf model (32). This shows that the Slonigiraf model is 4 times more efficient than the traditional one. Actually the performance of the Slonigiraf model is only 3 times better than the traditional because some students forget some skills.

## Financial model of the proposed educational reform

### We target 2 billion people in the world

To estimate the world population of students who will use our educational model, let's assume that only the 7-21 years old strata will use it. The percent of individuals **between the ages of 7 and 21** can be approximated by the [percent of individuals](https://www.theglobaleconomy.com/rankings/percent_children/) between the ages of 0 and 14. To calculate the target audience per country, we will multiply the [population size](https://population.un.org/wpp/Download/Standard/MostUsed/) as of January 1st, 2021 by the percentage of individuals between the ages of 7 and 21 and divide by 100%. The resulting data is shown in Table 1. As you can see, India has the largest target audience of 361 million people, and the total world target audience is 2 billion people.

### Wages of tutors and experts

When considering the wages of tutors and experts, it's important to note that a student who is skilled at tutoring can earn money by helping other students outside of school or university. Therefore, the wage of a tutor can be approximated by the lowest wage of a teacher in the country where they live. The wage of an expert should be higher than that of a tutor to incentivize highly qualified students to become experts. Since qualified students can find well-paying online tutoring jobs, the maximum teacher wage in the country where the expert lives can be used as an approximation of the market wage for experts. According to data from [salaryexplorer.com](http://www.salaryexplorer.com/?loc=23&loctype=1&job=123&jobtype=3#browsesalaries) as of January 8th, 2022, the maximum teacher wage on average is 3.16 times higher than the minimum teacher wage. Therefore, **an expert should be paid 3.16 times more per minute of work than a tutor**. In Ethiopia, teacher wages are the lowest among the countries listed in the Table 2, so a tutor in Ethiopia will have the lowest wage in comparison to other countries from the table.

|             | Min | Max | Max/Min |
| ----------- | ------- | ------- | ------- |
| India       | 143.42  | 458.21  | 3.19    |
| China       | 1637.81 | 4796.44 | 2.93    |

*Table 2. Teacher monthly wages in USD per country.*

### Diploma price and reimbursement amount

Let's calculate the reimbursement amount and mean diploma price by utilizing Ethiopia as an example, as its minimal teacher wages make it easier to work with small numbers in the calculations.

The minimum teacher wage in Ethiopia is 30.20 USD per month. To calculate the cost per minute of work, we must consider that a teacher works 21 days per month, 8 hours per day, and each hour is 60 minutes. Using these figures, we can determine that each minute of a teacher's work in Ethiopia costs 0.003 USD:

$30.20 / (21 * 8 * 60) = 0.003$

As previously discussed, we use the minimum teacher wage of a country as a approximation for the cost of tutor work. Therefore, in Ethiopia, a minute of tutor work costs 0.003 USD.

A reimbursement is a financial compensation paid by a tutor to an expert who discovers that a student does not possess a skill listed on their diploma. Experts must verify multiple diplomas to find one that is missing a skill, so we need to estimate how many diplomas are necessary. It is known that students [forget one skill out of four studied](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10643-022-01332-3), so an expert typically needs to verify four diplomas on average to get one reimbursement. Our experiments have shown that it takes an expert 1.5 minutes to verify one diploma, thus they spend 6 minutes (4*1.5) to get one reimbursement. Therefore, we can say that a reimbursement is equivalent to the cost of six minutes of an expert's work. As previously mentioned, an expert's salary is on average 3.16 times higher than the minimum teacher wage. Thus 1 minute of an expert work price should equal to 0.00948 USD in Ethiopia:

$0.003 * 3.16 = 0.00948$

And 6 minutes of an expert work is equal to 0.05688 USD:

$0.00948 * 6 = 0.05688$

Therefore, to incentivize students to engage in expert work, **the reimbursement amount in Ethiopia should be approximately 0.05688 USD**.

During a 4-year testing of the Slonigiraf educational model in different schools, we have identified experimentally that a tutor needs on average 11 minutes to teach a tutee one skill. Since a minute of the tutor's work costs 0.003 USD in Ethiopia, the tutor's work per skill costs 0.033 USD:

$0.003*11 = 0.033$

The tutor receives compensation from the tutee not only for their time, but also for issuing a diploma that can be verified by an expert. Without a premium for issuing the diploma, the tutor would incur a loss, as it is not possible to completely eliminate the possibility of the tutee forgetting the skill. As previously stated, tutees tend to forget 1 skill out of every 4 studied. Therefore, the tutor should add a premium of 1 reimbursement amount for every 4 skills taught, or $1/4$ of that amount for each diploma issued. As a result, the **total cost of a diploma in Ethiopia would be 0.04722 USD**:

$0.033+0.05688*1/4=0.04722$

If we divide the calculated reimbursement amount by the diploma price, we can conclude that the reimbursement is 1.2 times greater than the diploma price:

$0.05688/0.04722 = 1.2$

Because all issued diplomas go through verification, it is NOT profitable for a tutor to cheat the system by issuing a large number of fraudulent diplomas. Doing so would result in them losing 1.2 times more money than they would earn.

### Situations leading to earning and spending money

As we discussed above there are following roles in the Slonigiraf educational system: a teacher, an expert, a tutor of 0 tutees, a tutor of 1 tutees ...

Experts don't risk, they just earn. The teacher can lose some money if some of their mentees will forget the skill. But as he teaches only 1 student per a skill and also works as an expert he is always makes more money than he loses.

Any tutor spend money to learn a skill, earns money teaching others, and spend money if any their tutees forgets the skill. Thus a tutor profit can be written in formula:

$Profit = -D + D * N{_t} - R * N{_f}$

Where:

- $D$ - diploma price
- $R$ - reimbursement amount
- $N{_t}$ - tutees count of the tutor
- $N{_f}$ - number of tutees who have forgetten the skill.

If the a student doesn't have tutees then $N{_t}$ and $N{_f}$ are equal to $0$, and the formula gives us a profit value for these student equal to $-D$: they only pay for diploma to their tutors but don't earn anything.

As we calculated above the $R$ is 1.2 times bigger than $D$, so we can substitute $R$ in the equation above with $1.2*D$:

$Profit = -D + D * N{_t} - 1.2 * D * N{_f}$

Then we will put the price of the diploma out of brackets:

$Profit = D * (-1 + N{_t} - 1.2 * N{_f})$

You can see that $Profit < 0$ only if $(-1 + N{_t} - 1.2 * N{_f}) < 0$, or simply when $N{_t} - 1.2 * N{_f} < 1$

Table 4 summarizes when it can happen.

| Role              | $N{_t}$ | $N{_f}$ | $N{_t}-1.2*N{_f}$ | Losing money |

*Table 4. Cash flow outcomes of different roles*

### Losing money probability

If the student constantly faces money losses he will be bankrupt. Table 4 gives us insights which situations lead to money lost. Let's bring together the probability of playing each role and probability of losing money in each role. We will focus on the situations that lead to money loss. For example a "tutor of 5 tutees" paying 3 reimburses has a positive profit and we will not discuss that probability of such events in this section.

The probability of playing each role can be taken from fig. 2 and was calculated as number of students in each role divided by total number of students.

If student plays a role of a tutee and doesn't become a tutor he will lose money each time so the probability to lose money while playing a role of "a tutor with 0 tutee" is 1.

A tutee pays to their tutor not only to study a skill but also to get a diploma. Diploma is very similar to an insurance police because the tutor promises to pay a reimbursement to an expert if the tutee will forget the skill. As in insurance business bad things can happen by chance more often than expected and the tutor can run out of money due to reimbursements. The probability that a tutee forgets a skill is [0.25](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21574747/). Thus if a tutor has only 1 tutee he he faces 0.25 probability to pay a reimbursement.

The tutor having 2 tutees has 2 outcomes when he will lose money:

- both tutees forget the skill
- any one student forgets the skill

To calculate the probability both tutees forget the skill, we will think of them as independent events. So we need to [multiply probability of first event on the probability of the second](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_(probability_theory)). Thus the probability that a tutor having 2 tutees will pay 2 reimbursements is equal to $0.25 * 0.25 = 0.0625$.

The probability for such tutor that only first tutee will forget the skill is calculated in a similar way: $0.25 * (1 - 0.25) = 0.1875$, where $(1 - 0.25)$ is the probability that second tutee will retain the skill. The probability that only second mentee will forget the skill is the same: $(1 - 0.25) * 0.25 = 0.1875$. Thus a total probability that any one student forgets the skill is $2 * 0.1875 = 0.375$.

Other values in the column "Such reimbursement count probability for a role" of table 5 are calculated with the same approach. We will not provide the description of these calculations to be succint.

To calculate the probability that a student learning a skill will face a money loss due to a specific role facing N reimbursements we need to multiply the probability of playing such a role on a probability of such reimbursement count for a role, for example for "tutor of 2 tutees" that pays 1 reimbursements it is: $0.125 * 0.375 = 0.046875$. If we will sum all probabilities for such bad luck situations we will get that a student with a **probability of 0.629** will lose some money during any skill learning.

| Role | Count of reimbursements | Role probability | Such reimbursement count probability for a role | Probability of such situation |
| ----------------- | ---- | ------- | ---------- | ----------- |
| Tutor of 0 tutees | 0    | 0.5     | 1          | 0.5         |
| Tutor of 1 tutees | 1    | 0.25    | 0.25       | 0.0625      |
| Tutor of 2 tutees | 1    | 0.125   | 0.375      | 0.046875    |

### If we know that student lost money - what happened?

We have calculated the probability to lose money for a student while learning a skill. What if we know he already lost money, can we identify the reason of it? The answer is "No" but we can describe the probability of different scenarios. It's more likely the student was a tutor of 0 mentees, because the probability to play such a role and lose money is 0.5 (see the last column of table 5). And the 0.5 takes the most [share](https://calcworkshop.com/probability/bayes-theorem/) of total 0.629 probability to lose money. This situation is happen in 0.794876771 part of bad cases:

$0.5 / 0.62902832 = 0.794876771$

All such shares are calculated and represented in a table 6.

### Student starting capital

Our educational approach forces a tutee  to pay their tutor for skill-teaching and the issuance of a diploma, and requires the tutor to be responsible for the issued diploma by providing reimbursement when a tutee  forgets the skill certified by the diploma. To make this happen we need to assure that students have enough money for such economic interaction. As we discussed above there is a 62.9% chance that a student will spend more money during learning a skill that earn. For sure in rest 37.1% cases the student gets in sum the same profit as he losing in 62.9% cases, so their profit during years of learning should be near 0. But what if the student has a bad luck and all skills that he studies he is playing roles that lead to losing money? In such case he will start to pay for an education while we still suppose that the education should be a free resource for any person in on the Earth. To solve this problem we need to provide each student at the beginning of such approach enough money to prevent bankruptcy happening at all.

The probability to get back luck studying the first skill is a 0.629. Thus if our target audience is 1,966,096,793 people than $0.629 * 1,966,096,793 = 1,236,730,563$ of them will face it. The sequence of 2 bad luck cases starting at the beginning of our approach implementation will affect 0.629 part of 1,236,730,563 that is $0.629 * 1,236,730,563 = 777,938,548$ people and so on (see appendix 1, for all values calculations). About 19 million people will face with a sequence of 10 bad lucks learning first 10 skills.

Only 1 person in the world is expected to face a sequence of 48 bad luck cases from the very beginning, and nobody is supposed to face 49 bad luck cases during learning of 49 first skills.

As we mentioned we think that the education should be free so amount of money that we give to each student should be enough to wait out a sequence of 49 bad luck cases.

Some of such 49 cases will be happen due to that a student will not having a mentee, some - due to reimbursements. We known exactly what is share of each situtation in these 49 cases (see the last column of table 6), also we know how much money student is expected to lose in any such situation. So all what we need to calculate a total money loss in a sequence of 49 bad luck cases is:

- calculate count of each situation by multiplying 49 on the share of such situation in bad luck cases.
- multiply count of each bad situation on an amount of money loss in one such situation
- sum up values that we get in a previous step

This is done in a table 7 for Ethiopia. We can see that that maximum money that a student from Ethiopia can lose is about 2.214 USD.

| Role | Count of reimbursements | Part that such situtation takes in all bad luck cases | Number of such situations | Money lost per situation, Ethiopia (USD) | Sum money lost, Ethiopia (USD) |

### Total money amount needed to run the Slonigiraf system in a specific country

As 2.214 USD is needed for a one student from Ethiopia, and the total number of possible students Ethiopia is 46,974,914 we need 104 million USD for the whole country.

$2.214 * 46,974,914 = 104,004,973 $

Countries that have bigger teacher salaries than in Ethiopia should give more money to students at the beginning of Slonigiraf system integration. For example, in USA where the minimum teacher salary is 100.66 X higher than in Ethiopia, the student should get 222.87 USD:

$2.214 * 100.66 = 222.87$

The total number of money needed to drive the Slonigiraf system in USA for 61,376,828 students is 13.7 billions USD:

$222.87 * 61,376,828 = 13,679,152,692$

*Table 8. Money needed to drive the Slonigiraf system*

## How to give money out to students

Giving out money to students is not expected to largely affect inflation as the amount is very tiny in comparison to monetary base. For example we need to give out 13.68B USD to USA students. This amount comprise only 0.25% of [country monetary base as of November 2022](https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h6/current/). However this amount of money for sure needs to be approved by national governments that is unlikely to happen in easy way.

Another problem to which this approach can face is student behavior. The temptation to spend it immediately is strong for students when they receive free money. It's highly likely that students will spend all money before they will understood the necessity of having money reserve.

We think that a good solution for both these problems is an issuing tokens that are used only inside the Slonigiraf educational model. In such way students will get tokens instead of real money. This cost almost zero from a financial view, and prevents educational money spending before student understanding the value of tokens. Let's note that it's important to ensure students can't exchange tokens for money at the beginning of the educational reform otherwise we will face the same problem.

There are two ways of such token issuing. The fist one is to wait when a government will do so. In such way there will be know players in a private sector who can drive such a reform as all the profit will go straight to the budget. Thus it's possible that will not happen ever as there are other things that governments should do that are more lobbied. The second way is to issue such token and spread the emission between companies who want to make money on driving the educational reform. Let's name such token as SLON.

## SLON token price

As we discussed above SLON is a token that intended to be used in the Slonigiraf educational model by students instead of real money. We defined before that the diploma price and reimbursements vary between countries. From the most populated ones the minimum price of diploma is in Ethiopia. Let's define how much the diploma should cost in Ethiopia in SLON and what amount of reimbursement will be in SLON nominal.

The calculated diploma in Ethiopia is 0.04722 USD, the reimbursement amount is 0.05688 USD (1.2 x bigger than the diploma price). While selecting nominal for SLON token we should be sure that students will be happy using such nominal in transactions. The diploma price in SLON should have as low zeros as possible and it would be nice if the diploma price and the reimbursement would be whole numbers. Number 6 is minimal that is integer and get's an integer after division by 1.2. Thus we propose to use 6 SLON as a reimbursement amount and 5 SLON as a diploma price in Ethiopia. So at the same moment the diploma price in Ethiopia is 0.04722 USD or 5 SLON. This calculation gives us a price of 1 SLON to be around 0.01 USD:

$0.04722 / 5 = 0.009444$

## Diploma price and reimbursement amount in SLON nominal

As different countries have different teacher salaries, the diploma price and how many SLON should get each student will vary also. The table 8 contains such indicators calculated in USD. Let's present them in SLON by using the SLON price calculated above - see the table 9 below.

|  | Times min teacher wage  is larger than Ethiopian counterpart | Free tokens given to each student, SLON | Diploma price, SLON | Reimbursement amount, SLON |
| ----------- | ------ | ----- | --- | --- |
| India       | 4.75   | 1114  | 24  | 29  |
| China       | 54.23  | 12715 | 272 | 326 |

*Table 9. SLON token needed to drive the Slonigiraf system. All values are rounded up to the nearest integer.*

## SLON token monetary base

Previously we have calculated an amount of money that is needed to be give out to students at the beginning of the Slonigiraf educational model implementation. It's 98,343,946,528 USD. As the nominal value of 1 SLON is 0.009444 USD, then we need **10.4 trillion of SLON to give out to students**:

$98,343,946,528 / 0.009444 = 1.04134E+13$

10.4 trillion of SLON cost nothing at the moment of issuing, but cost 98.B USD after giving out to students, as they start to use them to exchange for tutoring work, and also for issuing diplomas.

In the proposed system, is the total demand for SLON estimated to be just 10.4 trillion? To answer this question, it is important to note that the supply of cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, is typically compared to M1 supply or narrow money. However, the supply of stacking cryptocurrencies is more closely aligned with M2 supply. The M2 money supply is [roughly equivalent to the GDP](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/FM.LBL.BMNY.GD.ZS). As the additional GDP is estimated to be 8 trillion USD, the M2 SLON supply should be approximately **8 trillion USD** or **847 trillion SLON**:

$8 / 0.009444 = 847$

## Long lasting effect of education improvement

GDP is closely tied to the workforce. Using a conservative estimate that 1% of labor growth leads to a [0.36% increase in GDP](https://dergipark.org.tr/tr/download/article-file/364734), the improvement in education resulting in a 3Х (or 200%) growth in the workforce would lead to a 72% increase in GDP, equivalent to approximately [69.5](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD) trillion USD in the long term. Based on this calculation, our initial estimation for the total demand for SLON tokens at 8 trillion USD should be revised upwards to 77.5 (69.5+8) trillion USD that could potentially lead to the cryptocurrency 10X price growth (77.5/8). Additionally the demand for SLON tokens could rise due to usage the system for corporate education and HR processes. In order to ensure the price stability, we plan to implement an inflation rate of approximately 10%. This inflation is achieved by generating additional SLON through the process of "stacking" and is a common practice in the current cryptocurrency market as a reward for the hardware maintenance.

## System software architecture

The proposed system, Slonigiraf, is composed of two interconnected components: [SLON](https://github.com/slonigiraf/whitepaper/blob/main/slon/ENG.md), which functions as a reputation system, and [GIRAF](https://github.com/slonigiraf/whitepaper/blob/main/giraf/ENG.md), which serves as a lobbying and legislation system. Both systems are implemented as distinct blockchains that are linked together through a relay chain. This design allows for the deployment of multiple SLON and GIRAF modules, enabling the system to handle a large scale of users and meet the diverse needs of the population. The GIRAF component is used to facilitate consensus on the types of skills that are necessary for education and the methods for teaching them. The term "SLON" is used both as the name of a Slonigiraf cryptocurrency and as the name of the module that stores information about recommendation letters.
