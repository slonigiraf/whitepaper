## Annotation <!-- omit from toc -->

We explore how education affects economic growth and present an education model that aims to outperform current models threefold. The model seeks to increase the number of acquired skills and has been implemented in several secondary schools with reported success. Our educational approach emphasizes peer-to-peer learning and addresses issues commonly encountered in this method. The model is expected to positively impact the world economy, potentially adding 8 trillion USD to the world economy each year. We also investigate how private enterprises can globally expand the proposed educational model, realizing profits from the reform, and examine the potential connection to artificial intelligence training and future use of it in education.

## Several Educational Models Are Known to Date

The world's most widely used educational model is the **traditional model**, also known as the "didactic" approach. This model is characterized by a teacher-centered approach, where the teacher is the primary source of information and focuses on rote learning and memorization. It is the oldest and most prevalent model of education and is still used in many schools around the world.

The curriculum is based on textbooks, lectures, and direct instruction, strongly emphasizing standardized testing and assessments. In this model, the teacher delivers information to the students. Students are expected to memorize and regurgitate that information on exams and assessments.
This model is still widely used in many countries, particularly developing countries and some parts of the developed world. Still, it has been criticized for not providing students with the critical thinking and problem-solving skills they need to be successful in the modern world. As a result, increasing calls have been for adopting more student-centered, interactive, and creative educational models that help develop the whole person.

Many other education models have been developed and implemented over time; some of the most well-known include:

**Montessori**: Developed by Maria Montessori, this model emphasizes a child-centered approach, emphasizing self-directed learning and hands-on activities.

**Waldorf**: This model, developed by Rudolf Steiner, emphasizes a holistic approach to education, with a strong emphasis on the arts, practical skills, and a solid connection to nature.

**Reggio Emilia**: This Italian model is characterized by a project-based approach, where children learn through exploration, discovery, and collaboration.

**Homeschooling**: This model of education is when the parents or guardians provide education to the child at home.

**Online learning**: This model of education is when the students learn through internet-based platforms; it can be synchronous or asynchronous.

**Peer-to-peer learning**, or P2P learning, is an educational model where students learn from and with each other rather than from a teacher or instructor. In a peer-to-peer learning environment, students actively participate as learners and teachers, working together to share knowledge, skills, and resources.

**Private tutoring** is an educational model in which a student receives one-on-one instruction from a tutor outside of a traditional classroom setting. The tutor can be a certified teacher, a retired teacher, or a subject matter expert. The tutor and student typically meet in person or online to work on specific subjects or skills. Private tutoring can be costly and not accessible to everyone. It also requires a high level of commitment and responsibility from the student and the tutor to succeed.
Each model has its strengths and weaknesses, and the effectiveness of a model can depend on factors such as the context in which it is implemented and the specific implementation of the model.

## The Traditional Model Is the Most Efficient Among the Known Alternatives

Education plays a vital role in the world economy. [On average, education comprises](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SE.XPD.TOTL.GD.ZS) 4.2% of GDP - final goods and services produced and sold in a specific period by countries. Suppose the quality of education was to be improved threefold. In that case, it could add approximately 8 (eight) trillion USD, or 8.4% of the global GDP, to the world economy each year with such effect size from the first year of educational reform.

[PISA](https://www.oecd.org/pisa/test/) (Programme for International Student Assessment) is a standardized test that measures the performance of 15-year-old students in reading, mathematics, and science in countries around the world. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) administers the test. It is widely considered a benchmark for evaluating the quality of education systems. Countries that consistently score high on PISA tests are often considered to have strong education models.

The most recent PISA results from 2018 indicate that Chinese students had the highest scores in all three subjects tested: mathematics, science, and reading.

The educational system in China can be characterized as traditional or didactic, which is a teaching method that is teacher-centered and emphasizes transmitting information from the teacher to the student. In this method, the teacher is the primary source of knowledge. Students are expected to listen, take notes, and memorize the information.

Therefore, any proposed educational model that aims to be widely adopted should be more efficient and cost-effective per student than the traditional model.

While the PISA test helps compare educational systems between countries and identify the most successful models, it is not intended for regular use in determining a model that outperforms the traditional one.

Another way to measure the efficiency of an education model daily is by determining the average number of skills acquired by a group of students, divided by the total number of skills they were expected to achieve. [Traditional education typically has an efficiency](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10643-022-01332-3) of about 25%, while using [private tutoring, the efficiency](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21574747/) can be increased up to 75%. However, private tutoring can be costly and requires many educators. Peer learning, where students tutor each other, [does not outperform](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23691355/) traditional education because of [two main challenges](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01443410500345172): the lack of motivation to teach among students and quality erosion due to "the broken telephone effect."

To address these issues, we propose using money to incentivize students to serve as tutors and require them to use a recommendation letter system to ensure the quality of such lessons. We have implemented this approach in several schools and observed increased education efficiency by up to 75%, with students having ample time for learning and teaching within their existing secondary education programs.

## Slonigiraf Is a New Educational Model More Efficient Than the Traditional

**Figure 1**

*The Proposed Educational Model Is Named "Slonigiraf"*

<img alt="Image" src="https://github.com/slonigiraf/slon-whitepaper/blob/main/img/lesson.png?raw=true" width="500">

*Note.* The model consists of peer-to-peer tutoring (leftmost pane), expert selection (middle pane), and diplomas verification (last pane).

### Students Pay Each Other for Issuance of Diplomas After Successful Tutoring

**The Slonigiraf lesson** does not include a traditional lecture component. Instead, it begins with students working in pairs. Students can act as tutors for a specific skill or as a tutee. Tutees have the freedom to choose their tutors based on personal preference. **Tutors are typically peers of the tutees** who have previously acquired the same knowledge through self-study or other means. A tutor, in the case that their tutee masters the skill, charges him **tuition fees** and **provides a diploma** certifying the acquired skill. If the student does not reach the skill, the tutor receives nothing.

Each diploma is a unique electronic document that can be invalidated at any time if an **expert** determines that the holder does not possess the skill. As such, each diploma includes information on the trained skill, the tutor, the holder, and the possible reimbursement amount. The expert will be reimbursed for identifying a fake diploma, with the reimbursement paid by the tutor who issued the diploma. The amount of refund is specified at the time of diploma issuance.

At the start of a lesson, there are frequently multiple tutors for a skill as they may have self-studied or learned it from their parents or prior schooling. As a result, the lesson begins with multiple tutor-student pairs.

Let's examine how a lesson proceeds when only one tutor is present. In Figure 1, the tutor is denoted as "A" in the leftmost panel. The tutor chooses a student who offers the most money or is based on any other criteria of their choosing. This session is marked as "session 1" in Figure 1. After this session, the student may then become a tutor themselves. Then, these two tutors can teach the skill to two more students. This process is called "session 2." Each session doubles the number of tutors. After session 1, there are two students with diplomas; after session 2, there are 4; and after session 3, there are 16. It can be briefly stated as follows:

$2^{sessions} = diplomas$

For example, $2^{5} = 32$, meaning that 32 students will have acquired the skill after five sessions. But what if the lesson takes place in a university setting, and the goal is to teach 512 students? Using the formula above, we can determine the number of sessions required by solving for $x$ in the equation: $2^{x} = 512$. Using a simple internet search or logarithm, we can find that $x=9$. Therefore, only nine sessions are needed to teach 512 individuals the skill.

### Tutors Have Different Numbers of Tutees

**Figure 2**

*Student May Have Varying Amounts Of Mentees*

<img alt="Image" src="https://github.com/slonigiraf/slon-whitepaper/blob/main/img/tutees_count.png?raw=true" width="500">

*Note.* For instance, in a class of 32 students, the maximum number of mentees per student would likely be 5, given that the number of mentors doubles in each session.

&nbsp;

To estimate what tutor roles students can play in the Slonigiraf educational model and what are probabilities of playing such roles let's examine a class consisting of 32 students. We will explain later why the chances of different roles are more or less the same in any student group size.

**Tutor of 0 tutees role**: as shown in Figure 2. half of the students (16 from 32) gains a skill in the last session. That means they will pay for tutoring and getting a diploma but will not earn money by tutoring such skill as there will be no students who need it. If the class consists of 32 students, there will be 16 such students (depicted with the digit "0" in Figure 2).

**Tutor of 1 tutees role**: $1/4$ of students (8 from 32) gain skill in a preterminal session. These students have one tutor and one tutee each, resulting in a zero net profit as the money earned from being a tutor compensates for the money spent on being tutored.

**Tutor of 2 tutees role**: $1/8$ of students (4 from 32) have two tutees.

**Tutor of 3 tutees role**: $1/16$ of students (2 from 32) have three tutees.

**Tutor of 4 tutees role**: $1/32$ of students (1 from 32) have four tutees.

**Tutor of 5 tutees role**: $1/32$ of students (1 from 32) have five tutees.

As the number of mentees increases, the probability of taking on such a role decreases significantly. We will not delve into the likelihood of having more than five mentees in larger classes, as the chances of such positions are minimal and would not significantly impact the calculations of our model economy.

Increasing class size has little effect on the probabilities of different roles. For instance, in a class of 64 students, half of the students will take on the role of "tutor of 0 tutees", which is the same probability as in a class of 32 students.

All students have a tutor, as all are required to obtain a diploma. The student with five tutees may receive their diploma by communicating with a tutor outside the group, such as a teacher or parent. As previously discussed, it is permitted to be a tutor without a diploma in the relevant skill; however, this increases the risk of failure. Hence, students typically choose first to study the skill, obtain the diploma and then teach others.

### Each Tutoring Interaction Is Focused on a Specific Skill

An important aspect of pedagogy is the structure and objectives of lessons and the expected outcome. However, in traditional education, there is no guarantee that teachers will have a well-defined plan or clear learning objectives for their students in each lesson. Allowing students to tutor their peers may exacerbate the problem as these student-mentors have yet to receive formal training in pedagogy.

We have implemented a simple solution to this problem. In this approach, every tutoring interaction focuses on only one skill per interaction. Tutors can easily access a method for teaching the skill from a database recommended by the teacher. Once the tutor determines that the student has mastered the skill, they can award a diploma that is specific to that skill. By using this approach, we can ensure that each tutoring interaction is focused on one particular skill and that the tutor understands the objectives of the interaction.

### Tutors Use a Simple Teaching Algorithm

As previously stated, teachers recommend tutors use a database containing records on how to teach each skill. To make tutors' work easier, we recommend that the teaching algorithm is always the same. Only the skill taught varies, but the teaching algorithm remains consistent, as shown in Figure 3.

The first step in the algorithm is to formulate a problem that the skill is meant to solve. For example, if we want to teach a student to add numbers, the problem can be formulated as: "What is the result of adding 2 and 3?" To ensure the tutee understands the situation correctly, the tutor asks them to rephrase the problem and waits until the tutee responds with something like: "What is the result of adding 4 and 2?"

The next step is to determine if the tutee can identify and correct errors in problem-solving. The tutor answers a problem formulated by the tutee incorrectly. For example: "The result of adding 4 and 2 is 3. Am I right?" If the tutee fails to detect and correct the error, the tutor provides the correct answer: "The result of adding 4 and 2 is 6. Repeat." After the tutee repeats the solution, the tutor asks them to formulate another similar problem.

When the tutee starts to identify and correct errors in the tutor's answers, the tutor asks them to come back the next day to work on this skill to ensure that it is ingrained in long-term memory. The next day, the tutor starts from the beginning of the algorithm. Suppose the student immediately corrects the tutor's error. In that case, the tutor awards the tutee a diploma for the skill and receives payment for teaching and issuing the diploma. If the tutee cannot correct the error immediately, the tutor continues working through the algorithm until the tutee can identify and fix mistakes and asks the tutee to return the next day.

**Figure 3**

*A simple pedagogical algorithm that can be used by tutors to ensure the quality of the skill training*

<img alt="Image" src="https://github.com/slonigiraf/slon-whitepaper/blob/main/img/algorithm.png?raw=true" width="500">

The pedagogical roots of such an algorithm can be traced back to error correction and feedback in learning. The algorithm is based on the idea that students learn best when actively engaged in the learning process and when they receive immediate feedback on their performance.

One of the main principles of this algorithm is to provide the tutee with a problem to solve and then ask them to rephrase the situation to ensure that they have understood it correctly. It is a crucial aspect of the "mastery learning" approach, which emphasizes ensuring students understand and master a skill before moving on to the next one.

Another key aspect of this algorithm is the focus on error correction. By providing the tutee with an incorrect answer and then asking them to identify and correct the error, the tutor allows them to practice the skill and receive immediate feedback on their performance, which is in line with the "formative assessment" approach that emphasizes the importance of ongoing assessment and feedback throughout the learning process.

Finally, the algorithm is based on the principle of spaced repetition, which is widely accepted as an effective way to promote the long-term retention of information. By scheduling follow-up sessions and reviewing the same material multiple times, the algorithm aims to help the tutee to internalize the skill and to make it a permanent part of their knowledge base.

The algorithm uses pedagogical principles such as mastery learning, formative assessment, and spaced repetition, effectively promoting skill acquisition and retention.

This algorithm can be utilized to train a wide range of skills, regardless of whether they relate to mathematics, linguistics, music, or sports such as tennis. For example, refer to Table 1 for an illustration of its usage:

### Some Students Become Experts

Holding a diploma does not necessarily mean that a student has fully mastered the skill in question. It simply indicates that the tutor believes they have. However, there are several reasons why this belief may be misguided. For example, the tutor may not possess the skill themselves, may not have adequately assessed the student's proficiency, or the student may have forgotten the skill. To ensure the quality of education, our model employs experts who verify diplomas and have the authority to award students with "A" grades or other types of rewards. The primary expert at the start of a lesson is the master teacher, who leads and manages the class. However, due to time constraints, they may need help to verify all diplomas. The teacher can delegate this responsibility to select students who have already obtained a diploma in the skill being taught. The teacher will first verify that these students possess the skill. If they fail the verification, the teacher will hold the original tutor accountable. Those who pass the verification will take on **the role of experts** and get a reward from the teacher.

### Experts Earn Money Through Identification of Low-Quality Skills

Why do students want to become experts? The expert status enables them to verify many diplomas and potentially identify ones not of high quality, resulting in reimbursement from the instructors who issued such diplomas. However, to prevent experts from falsely identifying all diplomas as low-quality to receive more rewards, students can choose which expert to contact. Such design creates competition among experts and promotes honesty.

The teacher can also re-verify diplomas that an expert has already verified if they suspect any cheating, such as the expert verifying a diploma they issued. In the event of cheating, the teacher can prohibit the student from being an expert for a certain period and also receive reimbursement from the instructor who issued the diploma used in the cheating.

### A Tutee Can Allow a Tutor to Review a Diploma Issued by Another Tutor

Skills that are acquired but not used are prone to be forgotten. So, many educational systems rely on repetition. The Slonigiraf educational model utilizes repetition in three ways:

- Allow students who have acquired a skill to teach it to other students. In this way, the student reinforces their understanding of the skill by teaching it to others.
- Our system uses repetition through expert verification of diplomas.
- Tutors can work with their students to verify previous diplomas issued by other tutors.

If a skill has been forgotten, the tutor who identifies the problem receives reimbursement from the tutor who issued the diploma in the same way as an expert. This process benefits both the current tutor, as they potentially receive reimbursement, and the student, as they receive information about their current educational problems.

A student and a tutor may conspire against a previous tutor to receive reimbursement while the student still remembers the skill. This type of deception is not prohibited in any administrative way. Still, it is almost impossible in the long term - such a student would be banned from the community of tutors as dishonest and would lose the ability to receive new diplomas.

### Comparing the Speed of Skill Acquisition of the Slonigiraf Model to the Traditional Model

In the traditional model, a teacher teaches a group of students all at once, typically spending 22 minutes. The outcome of this method is that only one out of four students will have learned the skill. For example, if a teacher is working with a group of 32 students, this approach will result in 8 students having learned the skill.

In contrast, the Slonigiraf model utilizes individualized instruction, where a teacher works with students one-on-one. In 22 minutes, a teacher using the Slonigiraf model can teach two students (11 minutes per student). The first student taught by the teacher will then teach another student. This results in 3 students acquiring the skill, whereas another teacher using a traditional model having the same time would have taught eight students.

But why do we argue that the Slonigiraf model is more efficient than the traditional one? The answer is because of other skills and other students. During 22 minutes, only three students will get the skill the teacher has started introducing to the group. But when these three students acquire such skill, other students will spread the skills that were introduced before. As any student in the Slonigiraf model has a 0.5 probability of getting a new skill per session, each student should learn some new skill during two sessions of 11 minutes. Therefore, it is important to compare not just the number of students who acquire a specific skill in the traditional model (8) versus the Slonigiraf model (3) but also the total number of students who acquire any new skill in the Slonigiraf model (32). It shows that the Slonigiraf model is four times more efficient than the traditional one. However, the performance of the Slonigiraf model is only three times better than the traditional because some students forget some skills.

### Teacher Salary Can Be Adjusted to the Quality of Teaching

**The role of a teacher** differs from that of a student in three ways:

- They are adults with pedagogical education
- They automatically play the role of an expert
- They have the authority to allow students to become experts

This allows for two different models of teacher salary calculation. The first is a more traditional approach, where the teacher receives a salary from the school budget. This model is likely to be more prevalent during the transition from traditional education to the Slonigiraf model. Under this option, the teacher does not receive any additional pay for tutoring or issuing diplomas. They teach 1-2 students for free and these students then spread the skill to other students for a fee. However, the teacher is still able to receive reimbursement from mentors in the same way as any expert, but the money received is added to the school budget and distributed among all students on an equal basis every month.

The second approach is more market-oriented, where the teacher does not receive any salary from the school budget. Instead, they are allowed to earn money both as a mentor and as an expert. The money that was allocated in the school budget for the teacher's salary is instead distributed among students on an equal basis every month.

### Linking Education to the Real World by Paying Students for Learning

The initial transition phase to the new educational system involves replacing traditional lectures with peer-to-peer tutoring and issuing diplomas. This change does not affect the salary of teachers and reduces their workload thus can be implemented smoothly. As a reward, students will get "A" grades as in the usual educational system. These grades are a form of payment for the opportunity to review their diplomas.

However, like any other educational approach, this system is not directly linked to the real economy and job market. Thus the next step is to pay students not with grades but with actual money. It would involve educational organizations purchasing the option to review students' diplomas. This approach aims to regulate educational content through the supply and demand market mechanism. This stage also divides the teacher's salary into two parts: the fixed salary they receive from the educational organization and the student payment for serving as tutors and experts.

The idea of paying students for their education may raise ethical concerns, as the traditional view is that education is valuable in and of itself. However, it is essential to acknowledge that all nations invest in education because it ultimately leads to greater economic growth in the long term. Therefore, students actively engaged in their studies contribute to this process and should be compensated for their efforts.

### The Slonigiraf Model Produces Training Data for Artificial Intelligence

Large language models, such as OpenAI's Chat, have shown the capability of generating text that resembles human-written text. However, the quality of these systems is contingent on the training data used, and the answers provided by OpenAI Chat may need to be more reliable for use as a student tutor.

The Slonigiraf model employs tutors to educate students on specific skills. By allowing tutors to communicate with the language model through dedicated skill-based conversations, a significant amount of text data can be generated for AI enhancement. Using recommendation letters as proof of tutor completion can further improve the quality of these dialogs. In essence, the AI can be seen as a student in the Slonigiraf model, learning directly from tutors, while experts can assess the quality of the tutor's work.

### Artificial Intelligence Bots Can Be Integrated As Tutors in Slonigiraf Model

When AI language models attain a diploma from a tutor, they can teach other human students and award them with diplomas. This vision provides a clear economic incentive for major tech companies to invest in training AI with the assistance of human tutors who are students from educational institutions.

## Financial Model of the Proposed Educational Reform

### We Target 2 Billion People in the World

To estimate the world population of students using our educational model, let's assume that only the 7-21 years old strata will use it. The percentage of individuals **between the ages of 7 and 21** can be approximated by the [rate of individuals](https://www.theglobaleconomy.com/rankings/percent_children/) between 0 and 14. To calculate the target audience per country, we will multiply the [population size](https://population.un.org/wpp/Download/Standard/MostUsed/) as of January 1st, 2021, by the percentage of individuals between the ages of 7 and 21 and divide by 100%. The resulting data is shown in Table 2. As you can see, India has the largest target audience of 361 million people, and the world's target audience is 2 billion.

**Table 2**

*Note.* The 7-21 strata percent value for the rest world was calculated as an average for the countries from the list above.

### Wages of Tutors and Experts

When considering the wages of tutors and experts, it's important to note that a student skilled at tutoring can earn money by helping other students outside of school or university. Therefore, the wage of a tutor can be approximated by the lowest wage of a teacher in the country where they live. The wage of an expert should be higher than a tutor's to incentivize highly qualified students to become experts. Since talented students can find well-paying online tutoring jobs, the maximum teacher wage in the country where the expert lives can be used to approximate the market wage for experts. According to data from [salaryexplorer.com](http://www.salaryexplorer.com/?loc=23&loctype=1&job=123&jobtype=3#browsesalaries) as of January 8th, 2022, the maximum teacher wage on average is 3.16 times higher than the minimum teacher wage. Therefore, **an expert should be paid 3.16 times more per minute of work than a tutor**. In Ethiopia, teacher wages are the lowest among the countries listed in Table 3, so a tutor in Ethiopia will have the lowest wage compared to other countries from the table.

**Table 3**

### Diploma Price and Reimbursement Amount

Let's calculate the reimbursement amount and mean diploma price by utilizing Ethiopia as an example, as its minimal teacher wages make it easier to work with small numbers in the calculations.

The minimum teacher wage in Ethiopia is 30.20 USD per month. To calculate the cost per minute of work, we must consider that a teacher works 21 days per month, 8 hours per day, and each hour is 60 minutes. Using these figures, we can determine that each minute of a teacher's work in Ethiopia costs 0.003 USD:

$30.20 / (21 * 8 * 60) = 0.003$

As previously discussed, we use the minimum teacher wage of a country as an approximation for the cost of tutor work. Therefore, in Ethiopia, a minute of tutor work costs 0.003 USD.

A reimbursement is financial compensation paid by a tutor to an expert who discovers that a student does not possess a skill listed on their diploma. Experts must verify multiple diplomas to find one missing a skill, so we need to estimate how many diplomas are necessary. It is known that students forget [one skill out of the four studied](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10643-022-01332-3). Hence, an expert typically must verify four diplomas on average to get one reimbursement. Our experiments have shown that it takes an expert 1.5 minutes to verify one diploma; thus, they spend 6 minutes (4*1.5) to get one reimbursement. Therefore, reimbursement is equivalent to the cost of six minutes of an expert's work. As mentioned, an expert's salary is, on average, 3.16 times higher than the minimum teacher wage. Thus 1 minute of an expert work price should equal 0.00948 USD in Ethiopia:

$0.003 * 3.16 = 0.00948$

And 6 minutes of expert work is equal to 0.05688 USD:

$0.00948 * 6 = 0.05688$

Therefore, to incentivize students to engage in expert work, **the reimbursement amount in Ethiopia should be approximately 0.05688 USD**.

During 4-year testing of the Slonigiraf educational model in different schools, we have identified experimentally that a tutor needs, on average, 11 minutes to teach a tutee one skill. Since a minute of the tutor's work costs 0.003 USD in Ethiopia, the tutor's work per skill costs 0.033 USD:

$0.003*11 = 0.033$

The tutor receives compensation from the tutee for their time and issuing a diploma that an expert can verify. Without a premium for giving the diploma, the tutor would incur a loss, as it is impossible to eliminate the possibility of the tutee forgetting the skill. As previously stated, tutees forget one skill out of every four studied. Therefore, the tutor should add a premium of 1 reimbursement for every four skills taught, or $1/4$ of that amount for each diploma issued. As a result, **the total cost of a diploma in Ethiopia would be 0.04722 USD**:

$0.033+0.05688*1/4=0.04722$

Suppose we divide the calculated reimbursement amount by the diploma price. In that case, we can conclude that the reimbursement is 1.2 times greater than the diploma price:

$0.05688/0.04722 = 1.2$

Because all issued diplomas go through verification, it is NOT profitable for a tutor to cheat the system by issuing many fraudulent diplomas. Doing so would result in them losing 1.2 times more money than they would earn.

### Situations Leading To Earning and Spending Money

The Slonigiraf educational system has the following roles: teacher, expert, tutor of 0 tutees, tutor of 1 tutee, etc.

Experts make money without taking risks, while tutors may incur a loss if their tutees forget the skill. Teachers only teach one student per skill and work as experts, so they consistently earn more than they lose.

A tutor invests in learning a skill, earns from teaching others, and may incur a cost if a tutee forgets the skill. Thus, a tutor's profit can be calculated using a formula:

$Profit = -D + D * N{_t} - R * N{_f}$

Where:

- $D$ - diploma price
- $R$ - reimbursement amount
- $N{_t}$ - tutees count of the tutor
- $N{_f}$ - number of tutees who have forgotten the skill.

If a student has no tutees, then $N{_t}$​ and $N{_f}$​ are equal to 0. The formula gives us a profit value equal to $-D$ for these students: they only pay for a diploma to their tutors but don't earn anything.

As determined above, $R$ is 1.2 times larger than $D$, so we can replace $R$ in the equation with $1.2*D$:

$Profit = -D + D * N{_t} - 1.2 * D * N{_f}$

Next, we will remove the price of the diploma from the parentheses:

$Profit = D * (-1 + N{_t} - 1.2 * N{_f})$

You can see that $Profit < 0$ only if $(-1 + N{_t} - 1.2 * N{_f}) < 0$, or simply when $N{_t} - 1.2 * N{_f} < 1$

Table 4 summarizes the circumstances in which it can occur.

**Table 4**

*Cash Flow Results For Different Roles*

### Money Loss Probability

A student who constantly incurs financial losses will become bankrupt. Table 4 provides insights into the circumstances that result in money loss. We will combine the probability of occupying each role with the probability of losing money in each role, focusing on the scenarios that result in financial loss. For instance, the role of "tutor of 5 tutees" paying three reimbursements yields a positive profit, and such scenarios will not be discussed in this section.

The probability of occupying each role can be obtained from Figure 2 and was calculated by dividing the number of students in each role by the total number of students.

If a student holds the role of a tutee and does not become a tutor, they will incur a financial loss each time. Thus, the probability of losing money while occupying the role of "tutor with 0 tutees" is 1.

A tutee pays their tutor not only for studying a skill but also for obtaining a diploma. The diploma serves a similar purpose to an insurance policy, as the tutor promises to reimburse the expert if the tutee forgets the skill. Like in the insurance industry, unfavorable events can occur more frequently than expected, causing the tutor to run out of money from reimbursements. The probability of a tutee forgetting a skill is [0.25](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21574747/). Hence, if a tutor has only one tutee, they face a 0.25 probability of paying a reimbursement.

A tutor with two tutees has two scenarios that result in a financial loss:

- Both tutees forget the skill
- Either of the students forgets the skill

To determine the probability of both tutees forgetting the skill, we treat them as independent events. Therefore, we [multiply the probability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_(probability_theory)) of the first event by the probability of the second. Hence, the probability of a tutor with two tutees paying two reimbursements is $0.25 * 0.25 = 0.0625$.

The probability for this type of tutor that only the first tutee will forget the skill is calculated similarly: $0.25 * (1 - 0.25) = 0.1875$, where $(1 - 0.25)$ represents the probability that the second tutee will retain the skill. The probability that only the second tutee will forget the skill is $(1 - 0.25) * 0.25 = 0.1875$. Therefore, the total probability of either of the students forgetting the skill is $2 * 0.1875 = 0.375$.

The calculations for the remaining values in the "Reimbursements' probability" column of Table 5 follow the same method.

To determine the likelihood of a student incurring a monetary loss while acquiring a skill due to a particular role with N reimbursements, we multiply the probability of occupying that role by the probability of the reimbursement count for that role. For instance, for a "tutor of 2 tutees" role that pays one reimbursement, the calculation is $0.125 * 0.375 = 0.046875$. Adding up all the probabilities of unfavorable outcomes gives us a result that a student has a **0.629 probability** of losing money while acquiring a skill.

**Table 5**

*Probability Of Money Loss In Various Roles*

\*\* "Scenario Probability" means the likelihood of a student losing money while acquiring a skill due to a particular role with N reimbursements.

### If We Know That Student Lost Money - What Happened?

We have calculated the likelihood of a student losing money while acquiring a skill. If we know that the student has already incurred a loss, can we determine the cause? The answer is "No," but we can present the probabilities of various scenarios. It's more probable that the student was a tutor of 0 mentees since the probability of assuming that role and losing money is 0.5 (refer to the last column in Table 5). This 0.5 value [accounts](https://calcworkshop.com/probability/bayes-theorem/) for the majority of the total 0.629 probability of losing money, occurring in 0.794876771 of negative cases:

$0.5 / 0.62902832 = 0.794876771$

All such shares are calculated and represented in Table 6.

**Table 6**

*Probabilities Of Various Scenarios That Lead To Money Loss*

| Student Role | Reimbursements | Scenario Probability | Share \* |
| ----------------- | - | ---------- | ---------- |
| Tutor of 0 tutees | 0 | 0.5        | 0.79487677 |

\* "Share" refers to the fraction of a particular scenario of all negative outcomes.

### Student Starting Capital

Our educational model requires tutees to pay their tutors for skill-teaching and diploma issuance and obligates tutors to provide reimbursement if a tutee forgets the skill certified by the diploma. To make this work, we must ensure that students have sufficient funds for these financial interactions. As previously discussed, there is a 62.9% chance that a student will spend more money while learning a skill than they earn. However, in the remaining 37.1% of cases, the student makes the same or more than they spend. It should result in a near-zero profit for the student over time. But what if a student has an unlucky streak and all the skills they study involve roles that result in money loss? In that case, the student would end up paying for their education, contrary to our belief that education should be a free resource for all people on Earth. To address this issue, we must provide each student with sufficient funds at the outset of this model to prevent bankruptcy from occurring.

The probability of experiencing bad luck while studying the first skill is 0.629. If our target audience is 1,966,096,793 people, then $0.629 * 1,966,096,793 = 1,236,730,563$ of them will experience it. A sequence of 2 bad luck events starting from the implementation of our approach will affect $0.629 * 1,236,730,563 = 777,938,548$ people, and so on (see appendix 1 for all calculation values). Approximately 19 million people will experience a sequence of 10 bad luck events while learning the first ten skills.

Only one person in the world is expected to experience a series of 48 bad luck events from the start, and no one is expected to experience 49 bad luck events while learning the first 49 skills. Education should be free, so the amount of money given to each student should be sufficient to withstand a sequence of 49 bad luck events.

Some of these 49 cases will be due to the student not having a mentee, and others due to reimbursements. We know the exact proportion of each situation in these 49 cases (refer to the last column of table 6) and the amount of money the student is expected to lose in each scenario. To calculate the total money loss in a sequence of 49 bad luck events, we need to:

- Determine the number of each scenario by multiplying 49 by the proportion of each scenario among bad luck events.
- Calculate the total loss in each scenario by multiplying the number of events by the amount of money lost in each scenario.
- Sum up the values obtained in the previous step.

The calculation for the maximum money loss for a student in Ethiopia in a sequence of 49 bad luck cases can be found in Table 7. The result shows that the student can potentially lose up to 2.214 USD in Ethiopia.

### Total Money Amount Needed To Run the Slonigiraf System in a Specific Country

To cover the maximum probable money loss of all students in Ethiopia (46,974,914), an estimated 104 million USD is required, calculated based on an average loss of 2.214 USD per student:

$2.214 * 46,974,914 = 104,004,973 $

Countries with higher teacher salaries than Ethiopia will require more funds for students at the start of the Slonigiraf system implementation. For example, in the USA, where minimum teacher salaries are 100.66 times higher, students will need 222.87 USD:

$2.214 * 100.66 = 222.87$

13.7 billion USD is required to implement the Slonigiraf system for 61,376,828 students in the USA:

$222.87 * 61,376,828 = 13,679,152,692$

Table 8 displays the calculations for other countries. The Slonigiraf educational model requires 98.3 billion USD to be distributed among students worldwide.

## SLON Token

### Giving money to students is challenging

Giving money to students presents several challenges. Inflation is the first concern. Printing money for educational reform will increase the country's monetary base. For instance, distributing $13.68B to US students will add [0.25%](https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h6/current/) to the country's monetary base as of November 2022.

The second issue in providing student starting capital is obtaining approval from national governments for the large sum of money involved. Since no politicians benefit personally, it's unlikely to receive support and promotion.

Educational organizations could resolve these issues by allocating a budget for student aid. However, this is unlikely as administrators would not personally benefit and therefore have no incentive to push for such reform.

This approach may also need help with student behavior, as students may be tempted to spend their free money immediately, leading to spending all of it before they realize the importance of having a reserve.

### We Address These Challenges with the Issuance of SLON Token

We propose using tokens specific to the Slonigiraf educational model to solve all described challenges. In such a way, students will get tokens instead of real money, preventing their spending before actual use in education. Furthermore, it presents opportunities for private businesses to generate revenue through selling tokens, thus driving the adoption of the Slonigiraf educational model.

Administrators and politicians running government or educational organizations won't issue tokens because they don't stand to profit from it. A private, profit-driven organization is likelier to issue a token to advance education reform, with emission distributed among companies seeking to profit from it. We will name this token "SLON."

### SLON Token Price

As previously discussed, SLON is a token designed to be used by students in the Slonigiraf educational model instead of actual currency. The diploma cost and reimbursements can vary between countries, with Ethiopia having the lowest diploma cost among the most populous countries. Let's determine the price of a diploma in Ethiopia in SLON and the amount of reimbursement in SLON nominal.

The calculated diploma cost in Ethiopia is 0.04722 USD, with a reimbursement of 0.05688 USD (1.2 times larger than the diploma cost). When selecting a nominal for the SLON token, it's essential to consider if students will be comfortable using it in transactions. The diploma cost in SLON should have as few decimal places as possible. It would be ideal if the diploma cost and reimbursement were whole numbers. The smallest whole number that gives an integer after division by 1.2 is 6. So, we propose using 6 SLON for the reimbursement and 5 SLON for the diploma cost in Ethiopia. At the same time, the diploma cost in Ethiopia is 0.04722 USD or 5 SLON. This calculation gives us a value of 1 SLON, being approximately 0.01 USD:

$0.04722 / 5 = 0.009444$

### Diploma Price and Reimbursement Amount in SLON Nominal

Countries have varying teacher salaries, leading to variations in the diploma cost and the number of SLON each student should receive. Table 8 shows these indicators calculated in USD. In contrast, Table 9 presents them in SLON using the previously estimated SLON value of approximately 0.01 USD.

**Table 9**

*SLON Token Needed To Drive The Slonigiraf System*

|  | Times min teacher wage  is larger than Ethiopian counterpart | Free tokens given to each student, SLON | Diploma price, SLON | Reimbursement amount, SLON |
| ----------- | ------ | ----- | --- | --- |
| India       | 4.75   | 1114  | 24  | 29  |
| China       | 54.23  | 12715 | 272 | 326 |

## Private Enterprises Earn Revenue by Advocating for Educational Reform

### Educational Organizations Acquire SLON Tokens to Establish Student Starting Capital

To utilize the Slonigiraf educational model, schools or universities must ensure that all students have adequate funding. As previously discussed, educational institutions cannot assume that all students are financially well-off and should provide starting capital for each student (refer to Table 8). Additionally, simply giving money to students is not a viable solution as they may spend it before realizing its importance for new forms of communication and education. To address this, schools or universities should purchase SLON tokens for students to use instead of money. The cost of purchasing SLON tokens is less than issuing and maintaining new tokens, making it a cost-effective option for any educational organization.

As stated in Table 8, the total demand for SLON by educational organizations worldwide is 98.3 billion USD, comparable to the net profit of the largest companies such as Apple or Microsoft in [2022](https://www.statista.com/statistics/269857/most-profitable-companies-worldwide/#).

### Some Students Stash Tokens Which Leads to an Additional Demand

Individuals have different tendencies when it comes to saving money. Some students may earn more SLON tokens than spend and save them for a "rainy day." It should lead to additional token demand by those students who spend more than they earn. These could be students from wealthy families with enough pocket money to buy SLON tokens out of the educational organization.

To estimate the tendency to save money, we can examine the monetary base in various countries and determine that the value of funds held in individuals' pockets and bank accounts roughly equals the country's GDP. Using this information, we estimate that students will likely need 8 trillion USD worth of tokens, as this is the additional GDP generated by this type of education. Therefore, we anticipate an extra demand of tokens totaling 7.9 trillion USD:

$8000 - 98.3 = 7901.7$

### Corporate Education Could Lead to The Demand Growth

In summary, we anticipate a demand for tokens from educational organizations to be 98.3 billion USD and 7.9 trillion USD from students from wealthy families. Throughout our analysis, we have primarily focused on students aged 7-21. Still, it is worth noting that adults also continue their education. We see the potential for implementing the Slonigiraf educational model in corporate training, which could generate additional demand for tokens. The global Corporate Training market was [valued at USD 345.56 Billion in 2021](https://skyquestt.com/report/corporate-training-market). We estimate that the Slonigiraf educational model can triple the educational efficiency. In that case, the additional GDP, as well as token demand, could reach approximately 691 billion USD:

$2*345.56 = 691.12$

### Long Lasting Effect of Education Improvement

GDP is closely tied to the workforce. Using a conservative estimate that 1% of labor growth leads to a [0.36% increase in GDP](https://dergipark.org.tr/tr/download/article-file/364734), the improvement in education resulting in a 3Х (or 200%) growth in the workforce would lead to a 72% increase in GDP, equivalent to approximately [69.5](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD) trillion USD in the long term. Based on this calculation, our initial estimation for the total demand for SLON tokens at 8.7 trillion USD should be revised upwards to 78.2 (69.5+8.7) trillion USD which could potentially lead to the cryptocurrency 10X price growth (78.2/8). We plan to implement an inflation rate of approximately 10% to ensure price stability. This inflation is achieved by generating additional SLON through the process of "stacking" and is a common practice in the current cryptocurrency market as a reward for hardware maintenance.

### Total Private Enterprises Profit From The Educational Reform

We estimated the demand for SLON tokens but didn't consider any expenditures to promote and sell tokens. SLON token is a software product; other software companies can approximate costs; for example [Microsoft's EBITDA comprised 49% of the sales in 2022](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/MSFT/financials/annual/income-statement). Let's produce simple estimations of EBITDA from selling SLON tokens to the different types of customers; see Table 10:

**Table 10**

*Total Private Enterprises Profit From Selling SLON Tokens*

| Customers                      | Sales, billion USD | EBITDA, billion USD |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------ | ------------------- |
| Educational organizations      | 98.30              | 48.17               |
| Students from wealthy families | 7901.70            | 3871.83             |
| Companies                      | 691.12             | 338.65              |
| TOTAL                          | 8691.12            | 4258.65             |

Thus we expect total private enterprises' profit from selling SLON tokens to be around 4 trillion USD.

### SLON Token Monetary Base

Based on our estimation, the demand for SLON tokens by educational organizations and corporate education is approximately 8.7 trillion USD. At a price of 0.01 USD per SLON token, the total SLON monetary base at the beginning of the system deployment should be 870 trillion SLON tokens:

$8.7 / 0.01 = 870$

### SLON Token Initial Distribution

As previously noted, there is minimal possibility of issuing tokens by governments and private businesses will drive the education reform. With several private companies already established and closely linked to school administrators, it's more advantageous to collaborate with them for SLON token distribution rather than compete for school funding. The SLON tokens are designed to be interchangeable, so distributing them to selling partners should provide the right incentives for them to sell the tokens to schools instead of holding onto them in anticipation of other companies doing all the marketing.

Furthermore, the open-source nature and lack of patent protection for the Slonigiraf project means incentives should be structured so that companies considering creating similar tokens would instead choose to become a sales partner for SLON tokens rather than issuing and promoting their own.

There are several factors to consider in building this system. Firstly, the price of SLON is rigid because its value is what drives educational organizations to purchase the token. Schools and universities cannot afford to buy cheap tokens as it would disrupt the underlying economy of their educational process and render the system ineffective. Therefore, schools intend to buy SLON tokens at a price of approximately 0.01 USD per token.

Secondly, while distributing SLON tokens through established distributors who already work with schools, there is a risk of missing demand if efforts are not made to promote the token through known schools, as other companies may reach these schools and universities first.

The third factor to consider is network effects. The SLON tokens serve as collateral for diplomas within the system, so schools prefer to use the same SLON tokens as other schools. This way, students can present diplomas from one educational organization to another, as they all utilize the same electronic system and tokens. As a result, after the initial distribution of SLON tokens, there will be a demand solely for SLON tokens and not others.

Considering this factor, it makes sense to collaborate with established sellers who are connected to educational organizations. Offer them SLON tokens at a significant discount to incentivize them to become token distributors. The discount should account for the possibility that these large distributors may threaten the system by issuing their tokens. It is essential to increase the cost of issuing alternative tokens and their promotion compared to SLON tokens.

The initial phase of SLON token promotion should focus on creating economic hurdles for creating and promoting alternative tokens. It includes the launch of SLON tokens in select educational organizations and extensive advertising to educate administrators of schools and universities on the benefits of using a unified SLON token instead of various substitutes.

The next stage is trading for the discount rate with distributors. Mean reseller discount rate in a [software industry is about 50%](https://brigex.com/channel-partnership-blog/f/commission-rates-in-software-reselling).

Therefore, we estimate that the company issuing SLON tokens will receive 50% of token sales and 50% of the profits, resulting in a profit of approximately 2 trillion dollars.

## System Software Architecture

### The Polkadot Blockchain Design is Well-Suited for The Slonigiraf Software Layer

The Slonigiraf educational model requires a transparent and fraud-resistant system for managing SLON token transactions. Blockchain solutions meet these requirements but face scalability issues for handling billions of user transactions. Ongoing research aims to increase blockchain transaction per second rates to match current industry standards of Visa and Mastercard networks. Approaches to improve blockchain transaction rates are developed by Cosmos Network, Ethereum, Bitcoin, Polkadot, Telegram Open Network, Solana, EOS.IO, Polygon, etc. It's tough to determine a clear winner at first glance, so we delved deeper by comparing Ethereum, Polkadot, Solana, Bitcoin, and Cosmos, which have the largest developer communities.

During the analysis, Solana was excluded from the list due to numerous reports suggesting its transaction rate per second and developer count [may have been falsified](https://medium.com/@CryptoSavingExpert/solana-tps-is-fake-and-massively-inflated-cyber-capital-founder-da2ff27b1ed4).

According to the listed blockchains, Polkadot emerges as the clear winner with its current transaction rate of 1,000 per second and a goal to reach 1,000,000 in one year, as illustrated in Table 11. Therefore, we decided to utilize the Polkadot architecture design to create the software layer that will manage SLON tokens in the Slonigiraf educational model.

**Table 11**

*Slonigiraf System Software Architecture*

<img alt="Image" src="https://github.com/slonigiraf/slon-whitepaper/blob/main/img/blockchain.png?raw=true" width="500">

The proposed system, Slonigiraf, is based on the principles of the [Polkadot blockchain platform](https://polkadot.network/PolkaDotPaper.pdf). It consists of two interconnected components: [SLON](https://github.com/slonigiraf/whitepaper/blob/main/slon/ENG.md), a reputation system, and [GIRAF](https://github.com/slonigiraf/whitepaper/blob/main/giraf/ENG.md), a lobbying and legislation system. These two systems are implemented as separate blockchains connected through a relay chain, allowing for the deployment of multiple SLON and GIRAF modules (see Figure 4). This design provides scalability and allows the system to accommodate many users while also addressing the varying needs of the population.

The GIRAF component of Slonigiraf utilizes the consensus mechanisms of Polkadot to facilitate agreement on essential education skills and teaching methods. The SLON module, which also serves as the name of the Slonigiraf cryptocurrency, stores information about diploma validity and tutors' reputation.
