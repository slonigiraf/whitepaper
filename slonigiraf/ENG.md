## Annotation

Slonigiraf is a distributed system designed to bring together concepts such as recommendation letters, lobbying, and legislation in projects of different sizes, from small societies of 10 people to entire countries.

Slonigiraf consists of two components: [SLON, a reputation system](https://github.com/slonigiraf/whitepaper/blob/main/slon/ENG.md), and [GIRAF, a lobbying and legislation system](https://github.com/slonigiraf/whitepaper/blob/main/giraf/ENG.md). Both systems are implemented as separate blockchains that are connected through a relay chain. This approach allows for the deployment of multiple SLON and GIRAF modules to parallelize workload and meet the needs of billions of people.
