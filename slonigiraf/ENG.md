## Annotation <!-- omit from toc -->

We explore how education affects economic growth and present an education model that aims to outperform current models by threefold. The model seeks to increase the number of acquired skills and has been implemented in several secondary schools with reported success. Our educational approach emphasizes peer-to-peer learning and addresses issues commonly encountered in this method. The model is expected to have a positive impact on the world economy, potentially adding $8$ trillion USD to the world economy each year. We also explore how private enterprises can expand the proposed educational model globally while earning a significant profit from this reform.

## Overview of existing educational models

The most widely used educational model in the world is the **traditional model**, also known as "didactic" approach. This model is characterized by a teacher-centered approach, where the teacher is the primary source of information and the focus is on rote learning and memorization. It is the oldest and most prevalent model of education, and is still used in many schools around the world.

In this model, the teacher is responsible for delivering information to the students, and students are expected to memorize and regurgitate that information on exams and assessments. The curriculum is based on textbooks, lectures, and direct instruction, and there is a strong emphasis on standardized testing and assessments.

This model is still widely used in many countries, particularly in developing countries and in some parts of the developed world, but it has been criticized for not providing students with the critical thinking and problem-solving skills they need to be successful in the modern world. As a result, there have been increasing calls for the adoption of more student-centered, interactive and creative educational models that help to develop the whole person.

There are many other education models that have been developed and implemented over time, some of the most well-known include:

**Montessori**: Developed by Maria Montessori, this model emphasizes a child-centered approach, with an emphasis on self-directed learning and hands-on activities.

**Waldorf**: This model, developed by Rudolf Steiner, emphasizes a holistic approach to education, with a strong emphasis on the arts, practical skills, and a strong connection to nature.

**Reggio Emilia**: This Italian model is characterized by a project-based approach, where children learn through exploration, discovery and collaboration.

**Homeschooling**: This model of education is when the parents or guardians provide the education to the child at home.

**Online learning**: This model of education is when the students learn through internet-based platforms, it can be synchronous or asynchronous.

**Peer-to-peer learning**, also known as P2P learning, is an educational model in which students learn from and with each other, rather than from a teacher or instructor. In a peer-to-peer learning environment, students take on active roles as both learners and teachers, working together to share knowledge, skills, and resources.

**Private tutoring** is an educational model in which a student receives one-on-one instruction from a tutor outside of a traditional classroom setting. The tutor can be a certified teacher, a retired teacher or a subject matter expert. The tutor and student typically meet on a regular basis, either in person or online, to work on specific subjects or skills. Private tutoring can be costly and not accessible to everyone. It also requires a high level of commitment and responsibility from both the student and the tutor in order to be successful.

Each model has its own strengths and weaknesses, and the effectiveness of a model can depend on factors such as the context in which it is implemented and the specific implementation of the model.

## Measuring education efficiency

Education plays a vital role in the world economy. On average, education comprises [$4.2$%](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SE.XPD.TOTL.GD.ZS) of GDP - final goods and services produced and sold in a specific time period by countries. If the quality of education were to be improved threefold, it could potentially add approximately $8$ trillion USD, or $8.4$% of the global GDP, to the world economy each year with such effect size from the first year of an educational reform.

PISA (Programme for International Student Assessment) is a standardized test that measures the performance of 15-year-old students in reading, mathematics, and science in countries around the world. The test is administered by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and is widely considered to be a benchmark for evaluating the quality of education systems. Countries that consistently score high on PISA tests are often considered to have strong education models.

The most recent PISA results, from 2018, indicate that Chinese students had the highest scores in all three subjects tested: mathematics, science, and reading.

The educational system in China can be characterized as traditional or didactic, which is a teaching method that is teacher-centered and emphasizes the transmission of information from the teacher to the student. In this method, the teacher is the primary source of knowledge and students are expected to listen, take notes, and memorize the information presented to them.

Therefore, it can be inferred that any proposed educational model that aims to be widely adopted should be more efficient and cost-effective per student than the traditional model.

While PISA test is useful for comparing educational systems between countries and identifying the most successful models, it is not intended for regular use in determining a model that outperforms the traditional one.

Another way to measure the efficiency of an education model on daily basis is by determining the average number of skills acquired by a group of students, divided by the total number of skills they were expected to acquire. Traditional education typically has an efficiency of about [$25$%](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10643-022-01332-3), while using private tutoring the efficiency can be increased up to [$75$%](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21574747/). However, private tutoring can be costly and requires a large number of educators. Peer learning, where students tutor each other, [does not outperform](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23691355/) the traditional education because of [two main challenges](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01443410500345172): the lack of motivation to teach among students and quality erosion due to "the broken telephone effect."

To address these issues, we propose using money to incentivize students to serve as tutors and require them to use a recommendation letter system to ensure the quality of such lessons. We have implemented this approach in several schools and observed an increase in education efficiency up to $75$%, with students having ample time for both learning and teaching within their existing secondary education programs.

## Slonigiraf - the new educational model

<img alt="Image" src="https://github.com/slonigiraf/slon-whitepaper/blob/main/img/lesson.png?raw=true" width="500">

*Figure 1. The proposed educational model is named "Slonigiraf". It consists of peer-to-peer tutoring (leftmost pane), expert selection (middle pane) and diplomas verification (last pane).*

### Students pay each other for diplomas issuance after successful tutoring

**The Slonigiraf lesson** does not include a traditional lecture component. Instead, it begins with students working in pairs. Students have the option to act as a tutor for a specific skill or as a tutee. Tutees have the freedom to choose their own tutors based on personal preference. **Tutors are typically peers of the tutees**, who have previously acquired the same knowledge through self-study or other means. A tutor, in the case that his tutee masters the skill, charges him **tuition fees** and **provide a diploma** certifying the acquired skill. If the student does not acquire the skill, the tutor receives nothing.

Each diploma is a unique electronic document that can be invalidated at any time if **an expert** determines that the holder does not possess the skill. The expert will be reimbursed for identifying a fake diploma, with the reimbursement paid by the tutor who issued the diploma. The amount of reimbursement is specified at the time of diploma issuance. As such, each diploma includes information on the trained skill, the tutor, the holder, and the potential **reimbursement** amount.

At the start of a lesson, there are frequently multiple tutors for a skill as they may have self-studied or learned it from their parents or prior tutelage. As a result, the lesson begins with multiple tutor-student pairs.

Let's examine how a lesson proceeds when there is only one tutor present. In Figure 1, the tutor is denoted as "A" in the leftmost panel. The tutor chooses a student who offered the highest amount of money or based on any other criteria of their choosing. This session is marked as "session 1" in Figure 1. After this session, the student may then become a tutor themselves. Then, these two tutors can teach the skill to two more students. This process is called "session 2." Each session doubles the number of tutors. After session 1, there are $2$ students with diplomas, after session 2, there are $4$, and after session 3, there are $16$. This can be succinctly stated as follows:

$2^{sessions} = diplomas$

As an example: $2^{5} = 32$, meaning that after $5$ sessions, $32$ students will have acquired the skill. But, what if the lesson takes place in a university setting and the goal is to teach $512$ students? Using the formula above, we can determine the number of sessions required by solving for $x$ in the equation: $2^{x} = 512$. By using a simple internet search or logarithm, we can find that $x=9$. Therefore, only $9$ sessions are needed to teach $512$ individuals the skill.

### Tutors have different number of tutees

<img alt="Image" src="https://github.com/slonigiraf/slon-whitepaper/blob/main/img/tutees_count.png?raw=true" width="500">

*Figure 2. Tutees count*

To estimate what tutor roles student can play in the Slonigiraf educational model and what are probabilities of playing such roles let's examine a class consisting of 32 students. We will explain later why probabilities of different roles are more of less the same in any student group size.

**Tutor of 0 tutees role**: as shown on a fig. 2. a half of students (16 from 32) gains a skill in a last session. That means they will pay for tutoring and geting a diploma but will not earn money by tutoring such skill as there will be no student left that need a skill. If the class consists of 32 students there will be 16 such students (depicted with a digit "0" on a fig. 2).

**Tutor of 1 tutees role**: $1/4$ of students (8 from 32) gain a skill in a preterminal session. These students have 1 tutor and 1 tutee each, which results in a 0 profit result as they compensate money paid to their tutors by money acquired by being a tutor.

**Tutor of 2 tutees role**: $1/8$ of students (4 from 32) have 2 tutees.

**Tutor of 3 tutees role**: $1/16$ of students (2 from 32) have 3 tutees.

**Tutor of 4 tutees role**: $1/32$ of students (1 from 32) have 4 tutees.

**Tutor of 5 tutees role**: $1/32$ of students (1 from 32) have 5 tutees.

With growing number of mentees the probability of such role is decreasing sugnificantly. We will not discuss the probability of having  more than 5 tutees in larger classes, as probabilites of such roles are too small to generally affect calculations of our model economy.

Growing class number doesn't much affect probabilites of different roles. For example 32 from 64 students class will play "tutor of 0 tutees" role. It's the same 0.5 probability of the role in class of 32 students. We can assume that our estimations of role probabilities are good in general.

All students have a tutor as all need to get a diploma. The student that have 5 tutees probably gets his diploma by communicating with a tutor outside the group. It can be the teacher of parent or any other type of the tutor. As we discussed before it's allowed to be a tutor while not having a diploma about the skill but for sure it rises the risk for the tutor to fail his work thus students tend to study the skill first, then get a diploma and only after this teach others.

### Students are allowed to become experts

A fact that a student got the diploma doesn't mean he has mastered the skill. It just means that his tutor believes in it. However the tutor can be wrong. For example, if the tutor himself doesn't posess such skill, or he didn't verified the skill proficiency of tutee by the adequete number of tasks, or the tutee can simply forget the skill. To maintain the good quality of education our system uses experts who verify diplomas and have a right to reward students with "A" grade or with any other type of reward. At the beginning of the lesson there is only one expert - the master teacher who runs and controls all the lesson. He is not able to verify all diplomas as it requires too much times. But he can delegate such position to few experts from students that got the diploma on the studied skill. The teacher verify that students that want to be experts posses the skill. If some of them fail the verification the teacher gets reimbursement from a tutor who issued the diploma. Those who passed such verification start to play **an expert role**.

### Experts earn money via searching for low quality skills

Why students do want to become experts? The expert status allows them to verify a lot of diplomas and eventually find bad ones and get reimbursement from tutors who issued such diplomas. For sure an expert want to name all diplomas coming to him as bad ones to get as much reward as possible. To prevent such situation we allow students to select which expert to deal with. This creates a competition between experts and makes them to behave honestly.

The teacher is allowed to re-verify diplomas verified by an expert if he suspects that the expert is cheating: for example if the expert verified the diploma issued by himself. In the case of cheating the teacher can prohibit the student to be an expert for certain amount of time and also the teacher gets the reimbursement from the tutor who issued the diploma used in cheating.

### A tutee can allow a tutor to review a diploma issued by another tutor

Skills that are acquired but not used are prone to be forgotten. To combat this, many educational systems rely on repetition. The Slonigiraf educational model utilizes repetition in three ways. Firstly, by allowing students who have acquired a skill to teach it to other students. In this way, the student reinforces their understanding of the skill by teaching it to others. Secondly, our system uses repetition through expert verification of diplomas. And thirdly, tutors can work with their students to verify previous diplomas issued by other tutors. If a skill has been forgotten, the tutor who identifies the problem receives reimbursement from the tutor who issued the diploma, in the same way as an expert. This process is beneficial for both the current tutor, as they potentially receive reimbursement, and for the student, as they receive information about their current educational problems.

It is possible that a student and a tutor may conspire against a previous tutor to receive reimbursement while the student has not actually forgotten the skill. This type of deception is not prohibited in any administrative way, but it is almost impossible in the long term - such a student would be banned from the community of tutors as dishonest and would lose the ability to receive new diplomas.

### Teacher salary can be adjusted to the quality of teaching

**The teacher role** differs in three ways from students:

- he is an adult with pedagogical education
- the teacher plays an expert role by default
- he can allow students to become experts

This allows us to propose two different models of teacher salary calculation. The first is conservative and doesn't change how things are done in classic way: the teacher just gets salary from the school budget. We think that such way will prevail during a transition from traditional educational model to the Slonigiraf. When this option is applied the teacher doesn't get money from students for tutoring and diploma issuing. He just teaches 1 - 2 students for free and they spread the skill to other students for money. However the teacher is allowed to get reimbursement from bad mentors in a way as any expert is allowed but the money he got in such a way then are collected to the school budget and are returned back to all students on an equal basis monthly.

The second way of teacher salary calculation has more market spirit. It assumes that the teacher will not get any salary from the school budget. In such way he is allowed to earn money both as a mentor and as an expert. The school budget money that were intended to be addressed to teacher are spread instead of it to students on an equal basis each month.

### Linking education to the real world through paying students for learning

The initial phase of transitioning to the new educational system involves replacing traditional lectures with peer-to-peer tutoring and the issuance of diplomas. This change can be implemented smoothly as it does not affect the salary of teachers and reduces their workload. As the reward, students will get "A" grades as in the usual educational system. These grades can be viewed as a form of payment for the opportunity to review their diplomas.

However, like any other educational approach, this system faces the challenge of not being directly linked to the real economy and job market. To address this issue, the next step is to pay students not with grades, but with actual money. This would involve educational organizations purchasing the option to review students' diplomas. This approach aims to regulate educational content through the market mechanism of supply and demand. This stage also results in dividing the teacher's salary into two parts: the fixed salary they receive from the educational organization and the payment they receive from students for serving as tutors and experts.

The idea of paying students for their education may raise ethical concerns, as the traditional view is that education is valuable in and of itself. However, it is essential to acknowledge that all nations invest in education because it ultimately leads to greater economic growth in the long term. Therefore, students who are actively engaged in their studies are contributing to this process and should be compensated for their efforts.

## Financial model

### It targets 2 billions of people in the world

As we propose such system for an education in groups we need to estimate the world population of students. To be conservative let's speak that only **7 - 21 yo strata** will use our educational model. We've found a data about total population size of each country as of [2021.01.01](https://population.un.org/wpp/Download/Standard/MostUsed/), and the data of [percent of 0-14 yo people](https://www.theglobaleconomy.com/rankings/percent_children/) as of 2021. We think that a percent of 7 - 21 yo strata can be approximated by the 0 - 14 yo strata. Thus to calculate the target audience per country we should multiply a population size on a percent of 7 - 21 yo strata and divide by 100%. The resulting data is shown in the table 1. You can see that India has the biggest target audience of 361 million people, and the total world target audience is **2 billion people**.

|             | Total Population | 7-21 years old % | 7-21 years old |

### Work force price

To discuss a work force price of tutors and experts we should remember that a student that understood how to be a tutor can potentially go to a educational market out of the school or university and get money for helping other students than his peers. Thus we can approximate the wage of a tutor with the lowest wage of teacher in the country that he lives.

The expert wage should be larger than the tutor wage to motivate most qualified students to become experts. As qualified students can find a good position in an online tutoring we can assume that the maximum teacher wage in the country where the expert lives could be a good approximation of the market expert wage.

We collected teacher wage data per country from [salaryexplorer.com](http://www.salaryexplorer.com/?loc=23&loctype=1&job=123&jobtype=3#browsesalaries) on 2023.01.08. From the Table 2 you can see that maximum teacher wage on average is 3.16 times higher that minimum teacher wage. Thus **an expert should get 3.16 times more money per 1 minute of his work than a tutor**. Teacher wage is minimal in Ethiopia so a tutor will get in Ethiopia the smallest wage in comparison to other countries listed in the table 2.

|             | Min | Max | Max/Min |
| ----------- | ------- | ------- | ------- |
| India       | 143.42  | 458.21  | 3.19    |
| China       | 1637.81 | 4796.44 | 2.93    |

| Average     |         |         | 3.16    |

*Table 2. Teacher monthly wages in USD per country.*

### $D$ - diploma price and $R$ - reimbursement amount

Let's calculate a reimbursement amount and a mean diploma price. We will use Ethiopia as a country with a minimal teacher wage to deal with small numbers during calculations.

A reimbursement is a money amount that a tutor pays to an expert who found that a tutee doesn't posses a skill which was underwritten in the diploma. An expert verifies several dimplomas before he can find one with forgotten skill thus we need to estimate such number of diplomas. It's known that tutees forget [1 skill from 4 studied](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10643-022-01332-3) thus an expert should spend a time to verify 4 dimplomas on average to get 1 reimbursement. We identified experimentally that an expert need 1.5 minutes to verify 1 diploma, thus an expert spend 6 minutes (4*1.5) to get 1 reimbursement. So we can say that a reimbursement is equal to a price of 6 minutes work of an expert. As we wrote previously an expert wage on average is 3.16 higher than minimum teacher wage.

Ethiopian minimum teacher wage is 30.20 USD per month. A minute of such work costs 0.003 USD:

$30.20 / (21 * 8 * 60) = 0.003$

Thus 1 minute of an expert work price should equal to 0.00948 USD:

$0.003 * 3.16 = 0.00948$

And 6 minutes of an expert work is equal to 0.05688 USD:

$0.00948 * 6 = 0.05688$

So, **the reimbursent amount should be around 0.05688 USD in Ethiopia** to motivate students to perform an expert work.

During 4 years of Slonigiraf educatinal model testing in different schools we have experimentally identified that a tutor needs on average 11 minutes to teach a tutee. As a minute of the tutor work costs 0.003 USD in Ethiopia than the tutor work per 1 skill should cost 0.033 USD:

$0.003*11 = 0.033$

The tutor gets money from tutee not only for his time but also for issuing a diploma that can be canceled by an expert. If the tutor will not get some premium for issuing the diploma he will lose money as it's not possible to completely exclude the situtation when tutee will forget the skill. As we mentioned tutees forget 1 skill from 4 studied, thus a tutor should add a premium of 1 reimbursement amount to each 4 skills that he teaches, or simply $1/4$ of such amount to each diploma issuing, thus **the total price of a diploma will be 0.04722 USD in Ethiopia**:

$0.033+0.05688*1/4=0.04722$

If we will divide the calculated reimbursement amount by a diploma price than we can conclude that the reimbursement is 1.2 times bigger than the diploma price:

$0.05688/0.04722$

As all issued diplomas go through the verification it's NOT profitable to a tutor to cheat the system just issuing a lot of number of diplomas because he will lose 1.2 times more money than earning.

### Situations leading to earning and spending money

As we discussed above there are following roles in the Slonigiraf educational system: a teacher, an expert, a tutor of 0 tutees, a tutor of 1 tutees ...

Experts don't risk, they just earn. The teacher can lose some money if some of his mentees will forget the skill. But as he teaches only 1 student per a skill and also works as an expert he is always makes more money than he loses.

Any tutor spend money to learn a skill, earns money teaching others, and spend money if any his tutees forgets the skill. Thus a tutor profit can be written in formula:

$Profit = -D + D * N{_t} - R * N{_f}$

Where:

- $D$ - diploma price
- $R$ - reimbursement amount
- $N{_t}$ - tutees count of the tutor
- $N{_f}$ - number of tutees who have forgetten the skill.

If the a student doesn't have tutees then $N{_t}$ and $N{_f}$ are equal to $0$, and the formula gives us a profit value for these student equal to $-D$: they only pay for diploma to their tutors but don't earn anything.

As we calculated above the $R$ is 1.2 times bigger than $D$, so we can substitute $R$ in the equation above with $1.2*D$:

$Profit = -D + D * N{_t} - 1.2 * D * N{_f}$

Then we will put the price of the diploma out of brackets:

$Profit = D * (-1 + N{_t} - 1.2 * N{_f})$

You can see that $Profit < 0$ only if $(-1 + N{_t} - 1.2 * N{_f}) < 0$, or simply when $N{_t} - 1.2 * N{_f} < 1$

Table 4 summarizes when it can happen.

*Table 4. Cash flow outcomes of different roles*

### Losing money probability

If the student constantly faces money losses he will be bankrupt. Table 4 gives us insights which situtations lead to money lost. Let's bring together the probability of playing each role and probability of losing money in each role. We will focuse on the situtations that lead to money loss. For example a "tutor of 5 tutees" paying 3 reimburses has a positive profit and we will not discuss that probability of such events in this section.

The probability of playing each role can be taken from fig. 2 and was calculated as number of students in each role divided by total number of students.

If student plays a role of a tutee and doesn't become a tutor he will lose money each time so the probability to lose money while playing a role of "a tutor with 0 tutee" is 1.

A tutee pays to his tutor not only to study a skill but also to get a diploma. Diploma is very similar to an insurance police because the tutor promises to pay a reimbursement to an expert if the tutee will forget the skill. As in insurance business bad things can happen by chance more often than expected and the tutor can run out of money due to reimbursements. The probability that a tutee forgets a skill is [0.25](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21574747/). Thus if a tutor has only 1 tutee he he faces 0.25 probability to pay a reimbursement.

The tutor having 2 tutees has 2 outcomes when he will lose money:

- both tutees forget the skill
- any one student forgets the skill

To calculate the probability both tutees forget the skill, we will think of them as independent events. So we need to [multiply probability of first event on the probability of the second](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_(probability_theory)). Thus the probability that a tutor having 2 tutees will pay 2 reimbursements is equal to $0.25 * 0.25 = 0.0625$.

The probability for such tutor that only first tutee will forget the skill is calculated in a similar way: $0.25 * (1 - 0.25) = 0.1875$, where $(1 - 0.25)$ is the probability that second tutee will retain the skill. The probability that only second mentee will forget the skill is the same: $(1 - 0.25) * 0.25 = 0.1875$. Thus a total probability that any one student forgets the skill is $2 * 0.1875 = 0.375$.

Other values in the column "Such reimbursement count probability for a role" of table 5 are calculated with the same approach. We will not provide the description of these calculations to be succint.

To calculate the probability that a student learning a skill will face a money loss due to a specific role facing N reimbursements we need to multiply the probability of playing such a role on a probability of such reimbursement count for a role, for example for "tutor of 2 tutees" that pays 1 reimbursements it is: $0.125 * 0.375 = 0.046875$. If we will sum all probabilities for such bad luck situations we will get that a student with a **probability of 0.629** will lose some money during any skill learning.

| Role | Count of reimbursements | Role probability | Such reimbursement count probability for a role | Probability of such situation |
| ----------------- | ---- | ------- | ---------- | ----------- |
| Tutor of 0 tutees | 0    | 0.5     | 1          | 0.5         |

| Tutor of 5 tutees | 5    | 0.03125 | 0.00097656 | 3.05176E-05 |

*Table 5. Probability to lose money playing a certain role*

### If we know that student lost money - what happened?

We have calculated the probability to lose money for a student while learning a skill. What if we know he already lost money, can we identify the reason of it? The answer is "No" but we can describe the probability of different scenarios. It's more likely the student was a tutor of 0 mentees, because the probability to play such a role and lose money is 0.5 (see the last column of table 5). And the 0.5 takes the most [share](https://calcworkshop.com/probability/bayes-theorem/) of total 0.629 probability to lose money. This situation is happen in 0.794876771 part of bad cases:

$0.5 / 0.62902832 = 0.794876771$

All such shares are calculated and represented in a table 6.

| Role | Count of reimbursements | Probability of such situation | Part that such situtation takes in all bad luck cases |
| ----------------- | - | ---------- | ---------- |
| Tutor of 0 tutees | 0 | 0.5        | 0.79487677 |
| Tutor of 1 tutees | 1 | 0.0625     | 0.0993596  |

*Table 6. Probability that a specific situation leaded to the money loss*

### $A$ - a student starting capital

Our educational approach forces a tutee  to pay their tutor for skill-teaching and the issuance of a diploma, and requires the tutor to be responsible for the issued diploma by providing reimbursement when a tutee  forgets the skill certified by the diploma. To make this happen we need to assure that students have enough money for such economic interaction. As we discussed above there is a 62.9% chance that a student will spend more money during learning a skill that earn. For sure in rest 37.1% cases the student gets in sum the same profit as he losing in 62.9% cases, so his profit during years of learning should be near 0. But what if the student has a bad luck and all skills that he studies he is playing roles that lead to losing money? In such case he will start to pay for an education while we still suppose that the education should be a free resource for any person in on the Earth. To solve this problem we need to provide each student at the beginning of such approach enough money to prevent bankruptcy happening at all.

The probability to get back luck studying the first skill is a 0.629. Thus if our target audience is 1,966,096,793 people than $0.629 * 1,966,096,793 = 1,236,730,563$ of them will face it. The sequence of 2 bad luck cases starting at the beginning of our approach implementation will affect 0.629 part of 1,236,730,563 that is $0.629 * 1,236,730,563 = 777,938,548$ people and so on (see appendix 1, for all values calculations). About 19 million people will face with a sequence of 10 bad lucks learning first 10 skills.

Only 1 person in the world is expected to face a sequence of 48 bad luck cases from the very beginning, and nobody is supposed to face 49 bad luck cases during learning of 49 first skills.

As we mentioned we think that the education should be free so amount of money that we give to each student should be enough to wait out a sequence of 49 bad luck cases.

Some of such 49 cases will be happen due to that a student will not having a mentee, some - due to reimbursements. We known exactly what is share of each situtation in these 49 cases (see the last column of table 6), also we know how much money student is expected to lose in any such situation. So all what we need to calculate a total money loss in a sequence of 49 bad luck cases is:

- calculate count of each situation by multiplying 49 on the share of such situation in bad luck cases.
- multiply count of each bad situation on an amount of money loss in one such situation
- sum up values that we get in a previous step

This is done in a table 7 for Ethiopia. We can see that that maximum money that a student from Ethiopia can lose is about 2.214 USD.

| Role | Count of reimbursements | Part that such situtation takes in all bad luck cases | Number of such situations | Money lost per situation, Ethiopia (USD) | Sum money lost, Ethiopia (USD) |

*Table 7. Maximum probable money loss, calculated per a student from Ethiopia*

### Total money amount needed to run the Slonigiraf system in a specific country

As 2.214 USD is needed for a one student from Ethiopia, and the total number of possible students Ethiopia is 46,974,914 we need 104 million USD for the whole country.

$2.214 * 46,974,914 = 104,004,973 $

Countries that have bigger teacher salaries than in Ethiopia should give more money to students at the beginning of Slonigiraf system integration. For example, in USA where the minimum teacher salary is 100.66 X higher than in Ethiopia, the student should get 222.87 USD:

$2.214 * 100.66 = 222.87$

The total number of money needed to drive the Slonigiraf system in USA for 61,376,828 students is 13.7 billions USD:

$222.87 * 61,376,828 = 13,679,152,692$

*Table 8. Money needed to drive the Slonigiraf system*

## How to give money out to students

Giving out money to students is not expected to largely affect inflation as the amount is very tiny in comparison to monetary base. For example we need to give out 13.68B USD to USA students. This amount comprise only 0.25% of [country monetary base as of November 2022](https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h6/current/). However this amount of money for sure needs to be approved by national governments that is unlikely to happen in easy way.

Another problem to which this approach can face is student behavior. The temptation to spend it immediately is strong for students when they receive free money. It's highly likely that students will spend all money before they will understood the necessity of having money reserve.

We think that a good solution for both these problems is an issuing tokens that are used only inside the Slonigiraf educational model. In such way students will get tokens instead of real money. This cost almost zero from a financial view, and prevents educational money spending before student understanding the value of tokens. Let's note that it's important to ensure students can't exchange tokens for money at the beginning of the educational reform otherwise we will face the same problem.

There are two ways of such token issuing. The fist one is to wait when a government will do so. In such way there will be know players in a private sector who can drive such a reform as all the profit will go straight to the budget. Thus it's possible that will not happen ever as there are other things that governments should do that are more lobbied. The second way is to issue such token and spread the emission between companies who want to make money on driving the educational reform. Let's name such token as SLON.

## SLON token price

As we discussed above SLON is a token that intended to be used in the Slonigiraf educational model by students instead of real money. We defined before that the diploma price and reimbursements vary between countries. From the most populated ones the minimum price of diploma is in Ethiopia. Let's define how much the diploma should cost in Ethiopia in SLON and what amount of reimbursement will be in SLON nominal.

The calculated diploma in Ethiopia is 0.04722 USD, the reimbursement amount is 0.05688 USD (1.2 x bigger than the diploma price). While selecting nominal for SLON token we should be sure that students will be happy using such nominal in transactions. The diploma price in SLON should have as low zeros as possible and it would be nice if the diploma price and the reimbursement would be whole numbers. Number 6 is minimal that is integer and get's an integer after division by 1.2. Thus we propose to use 6 SLON as a reimbursement amount and 5 SLON as a diploma price in Ethiopia. So at the same moment the diploma price in Ethiopia is 0.04722 USD or 5 SLON. This calculation gives us a price of 1 SLON to be around 0.01 USD:

$0.04722 / 5 = 0.009444$

## Diploma price and reimbursement amount in SLON nominal

As different countries have different teacher salaries, the diploma price and how many SLON should get each student will vary also. The table 8 contains such indicators calculated in USD. Let's present them in SLON by using the SLON price calculated above - see the table 9 below.

|  | Times min teacher wage  is larger than Ethiopian counterpart | Free tokens given to each student, SLON | Diploma price, SLON | Reimbursement amount, SLON |
| ----------- | ------ | ----- | --- | --- |
| India       | 4.75   | 1114  | 24  | 29  |
| China       | 54.23  | 12715 | 272 | 326 |

*Table 9. SLON token needed to drive the Slonigiraf system. All values are rounded up to the nearest integer.*

## SLON token monetary base

Previously we have calculated an amount of money that is needed to be give out to students at the beginning of the Slonigiraf educational model implementation. It's 98,343,946,528 USD. As the nominal value of 1 SLON is 0.009444 USD, then we need **10.4 trillion of SLON to give out to students**:

$98,343,946,528 / 0.009444 = 1.04134E+13$

10.4 trillion of SLON cost nothing at the moment of issuing, but cost 98.B USD after giving out to students, as they start to use them to exchange for tutoring work, and also for issuing diplomas.

In the proposed system, is the total demand for SLON estimated to be just 10.4 trillion? To answer this question, it is important to note that the supply of cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, is typically compared to M1 supply or narrow money. However, the supply of stacking cryptocurrencies is more closely aligned with M2 supply. The M2 money supply is [roughly equivalent to the GDP](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/FM.LBL.BMNY.GD.ZS). As the additional GDP is estimated to be 8 trillion USD, the M2 SLON supply should be approximately **8 trillion USD** or **847 trillion SLON**:

$8 / 0.009444 = 847$

## Long lasting effect of education improvement

GDP is closely tied to the workforce. Using a conservative estimate that 1% of labor growth leads to a [0.36% increase in GDP](https://dergipark.org.tr/tr/download/article-file/364734), the improvement in education resulting in a 3Х (or 200%) growth in the workforce would lead to a 72% increase in GDP, equivalent to approximately [69.5](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD) trillion USD in the long term. Based on this calculation, our initial estimation for the total demand for SLON tokens at 8 trillion USD should be revised upwards to 77.5 (69.5+8) trillion USD that could potentially lead to the cryptocurrency 10X price growth (77.5/8). Additionally the demand for SLON tokens could rise due to usage the system for corporate education and HR processes. In order to ensure the price stability, we plan to implement an inflation rate of approximately 10%. This inflation is achieved by generating additional SLON through the process of "stacking" and is a common practice in the current cryptocurrency market as a reward for the hardware maintenance.

The proposed system, Slonigiraf, is composed of two interconnected components: [SLON](https://github.com/slonigiraf/whitepaper/blob/main/slon/ENG.md), which functions as a reputation system, and [GIRAF](https://github.com/slonigiraf/whitepaper/blob/main/giraf/ENG.md), which serves as a lobbying and legislation system. Both systems are implemented as distinct blockchains that are linked together through a relay chain. This design allows for the deployment of multiple SLON and GIRAF modules, enabling the system to handle a large scale of users and meet the diverse needs of the population. The GIRAF component is used to facilitate consensus on the types of skills that are necessary for education and the methods for teaching them. The term "SLON" is used both as the name of a Slonigiraf cryptocurrency and as the name of the module that stores information about recommendation letters.
