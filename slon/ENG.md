## Annotation

Reputation is a crucial aspect of economic activity and is necessary for rapid growth. In this article, I propose a new approach to digitalizing reputation that is resistant to discrimination, simplifies the hiring process and has the potential to revolutionize education in schools, universities, and businesses.

Recommendation letters are a decentralized method of managing reputation that has been effective and reliable for centuries. In this system, a referee recommends a worker to an employer. However, traditional recommendation letters lack responsibility on the part of the referee, as an evil referee could issue a fake recommendation that would harm the employer. It limits the use of recommendations in hiring and wastes time as workers and HR specialists have to repeatedly re-examine the same skills in different companies due to the lack of trust in referees.

To address this problem, I propose splitting a person's reputation into two parts: electronic recommendation letters issued about the person, backed by the referees' SLON balance, and the SLON token balance of the person as a referee. With this approach, an employer can reduce the SLON tokens of an unscrupulous referee if a worker lacks the skills mentioned in a recommendation letter. The employer can then sell these SLON tokens on the open market to compensate for the time lost by HR specialists in re-examining a fake recommendation.

A good referee may be penalized if a worker forgets the skills mentioned in the recommendation. To mitigate this risk, the worker should pay a premium to the referee, similar to an insurance model. In this way, the referee will retain money in the long term.

This system was initially developed at the Slonigiraf private school to motivate teachers to perform well and eventually led to a peer-to-peer learning model. Every student can act as a mentor and issue a recommendation about their mentee. The mentee pays the mentor for teaching and issuing a recommendation letter (diploma). The senior teacher buys recommendation letters about mentees giving them high grades (or money). This approach has the potential to transform all types of education.

The proposed reputation system resists Big Brother surveillance and any form of discrimination. All recommendation letters are stored privately on personal devices and are only shown to organizations that the person trusts. Additionally, accounts are pseudonymous, like in Bitcoin, and a person can have multiple accounts to store SLON tokens. The SLON token balance cannot be transformed into a discriminatory social credit system (e.g., the Chinese system) because anyone can buy SLON. If a criminal buys SLON and has a high SLON balance, it does not make them good or socially acceptable.

## Recommendation Letter as an Insurance

Insurance is needed to protect from financial loss. Recommendations backed by SLON are [insurances](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance).

An organization that provides insurance is known as an underwriter. A person who buys insurance is known as a policyholder, and a person covered under the policy is called an insured.
In the case of the SLON recommendation letter, the referee is the underwriter, the worker is the policyholder, and the employer is the insured.

The insurance creation requires a payment from the policyholder to the insurer, known as a premium, in exchange for the insurer's obligation to reimburse the insured in case of a covered loss. SLON recommendation letter creation also requires the premium which the worker pays to the referee.

A contract provided to the policyholder is called the insurance policy, which explains in which case the insurer will compensate the insured. The recommendation letter is the insurance policy.

Note that the worker can optionally charge money from the employer for the insurance policy (recommendation letter) usage.

In a case of a loss, the insured submits a claim to the insurer for processing by a [claims adjuster](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/claims-adjuster.asp). The claims adjuster determines the extent of the underwriter's liability. In the case of the SLON recommendation letter, the employer itself is a claims adjuster. However, the employer can't make unfair decisions because it will ruin its public creditability and hiring process: no new workers will wish to provide recommendation letters to such an employer.

**Table 1**

*SLON Recommendation Letters in Terms of Insurances*

| Insurances | SLON Recommendation Letters |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Underwriter | Referee |
| Policyholder | Worker |
| Insured | Employer |
| Insurance policy | Recommendation letter |
| Premium | A payment from a worker to the referee for a recommendation creation |
| Covered loss | Employer's financial loss due to a lack of skills of the worker |
| Claims Adjuster | The employer itself that monitored by the worker and the referee |
| Reimbursement | SLON token transfer from the referee to the employer |

&nbsp;

- A refeeree buys SLON tokens to issue recommendations
- The refeeree sell a recommendation letter to a trusted worker about the worker
- The worker sell (or transfer for free) the right to slash the referee to an employer during interview to get a job
- In case of the fake recommendation the employer slashes the referee and sell SLON to compensate time of HR specialist lost for interviewing the worker that lacks skills mentioned in the recommendation letter

Paid interview is a known instrument to recruit a specialist when there is a deficit of qualified candidates. The recommendation letter market can save a budget for paid interviews because employers can get a reimbursement for a weak candidate.

## Corporate Education

In the proposed model, corporate education can be transformed by allowing employees to act as mentors and issue recommendations about their mentees, who would then pay the mentor for teaching and issuing a recommendation. This approach could replace traditional training programs and allow for a more personalized and tailored learning experience for employees.

In this system, the HR manager or company director could buy recommendation letters about mentees. It would create a financial incentive for mentees to learn and perform well and a financial incentive for employees to share their knowledge and skills with their colleagues.

Overall, this model has the potential to create a more efficient and effective corporate education system that is tailored to the needs and goals of individual employees. It could also foster a culture of continuous learning and development within the organization.

## School and University Education

Education is lagging behind the changes in the world. Companies need new skills, and educational organizations don't have time to teach them. Often, education does not even know about their relevance.

We are solving this problem with the help of the market. The market always knows what skills are needed, how to teach them and for whom they are needed. In modern markets, the value is not the product itself, but the guarantee of its quality, thanks to which you can replace the product or get money.

According to the Slonigiraf system, a student buys a skill guarantee from a teacher and resells it to the company they work for or to a philanthropist who finances the student's education. The guarantee allows them to take an asset from the teacher, SLON coins, in the amount that is recorded in the guarantee, if the student's skill disappeared. SLON coins play the role of a teacher's digital reputation that can be bought and sold.

## Reputation

Reputation is a measure of public confidence. Using reputation allows you to reduce costs in the economy, trust is profitable. However, reputation cannot be used if a person changes their social circle. In addition, a reputation is slow to respond to mistakes and oversights of its owner.

Digital reputation is devoid of these problems, but it has a different negative side. For example, in China, where the government is the operator of the reputation base, you may be denied access to public transport, issuing loans, etc. if you have a low digital reputation. At the same time, you can increase it only by changing your behavior in a way pleasing to the state.

The digital reputation of SLON is free from this drawback and does not lead to discrimination of the owners, since SLON is available for purchase.

## Guarantees

Anyone can use a SLON reputation to issue a guarantee for another person's skill. Because the issuance of a guarantee can lead to a decrease in reputation, the guarantor asks for a certain amount of money from the recipient of the guarantee in exchange for its issuance.

Most often, teachers act as guarantors, and students buy guarantees in the hope of reselling them to future employers or patrons.

To issue a guarantee, the teacher must create an account within the Slonigiraf system and transfer the required amount of SLON there. The number of SLONs on this account is known to all Slonigiraf users. Thanks to this information, they know that the guarantee can be used and the amount of SLON specified in the guarantee can be debited from the teacher's account. SLONs on the teacher's account are not blocked in any way. You can, for example, put 100 SLON on your account and issue 5 guarantees, each of which will allow you to fine the teacher by 100 SLON. After the execution of the penalty on the first guarantee, the account will be reset to zero, and everyone will know that the other 4 guarantees are not valid yet. If the teacher refills his account with 100 SLON, these 4 guarantees will become invalid again. An example of the application of the Slonigiraf methodology in a public school can be seen in Fig. 2.

## Data Storage

In order for the Slonigiraf system to be used to train a large number of people, we need to process a huge number of transactions per second.

We chose a well-known network architecture [Polkadot](https://polkadot.network/), which consists of computers storing a base with SLON balances - a relay chain, and computers storing a guarantee base - parachains. The main load falls on parachains, scaling occurs due to the fact that hundreds of guarantee bases can be created, for example, one for each country.

The relay chain also protects the parachains from attacks.

## Appendix 1 - Protocol Design

1. A student finds a teacher - somewhere offline based on a knowledge field, personal considerations and amount of SLON at the teacher's escrow account.
2. The student and teacher trade with each other on the price of insurance issuing during this session and a number of insurances that the student gives to the teacher for revalidation.
3. The student sends a list of insurances to revalidate - they should be linked to a teacher account with escrow that balance is more than possible fine.
4. The teacher revalidates them and fines previous teachers for invalid insurances.
5. The student sends a list of the skills to be discussed at the session to the teacher
6. The teacher marks at his own device which skills are good and which are not.
7. The teacher tells the student an amount of SLON to pay for total insurance on good skills.
8. The student transfer the required amount of SLON to teacher personal account
9. The teacher signes with his private key a hash (1) that contains a long random number concatenated with the skill ipfs hash with an address of the student and separately the same just without ipfs hash.

Each such paired data - is one insurance. And transfer these to the student.

Secret skill:

skill\_ipfs\_hash | insurance\_id | teach\_address | stud\_address | amount | teach\_sign\_1

Skill receipt:

insurance\_id | teach\_address | stud\_address | amount | teach\_sign\_2

Skill info:

skill\_ipfs\_hash | insurance\_id | teach\_address | stud\_address | amount | teach\_sign\_1 | teach\_sign\_2

Skill insurance:

insurance\_id | teach\_address | stud\_address | amount | teach\_sign\_2 | employer\_address | stud\_sign

insurance\_id - u32 value

Ex: 5

teach\_address, stud\_address, employer\_address - substrate accounts.

Ex: 5GrwvaEF5zXb26Fz9rcQpDWS57CtERHpNehXCPcNoHGKutQY

Both skill receipt and skill insurances can be sent to the blockchain.

transaction\_id is stored at map containing teacher info

1. The student goes to the company. The company buys the: part2 of insurance concatenated to the company address + sign of it by student private key. Thus the company can send an instruction to blockchain: send money from teacher to company. The information stored at blockchain: address of insurer, address who gets a reward, the amount and hash (1).

used insurances are stored in map

H256 -\&gt; H512

where H256 = hash(Identity+insurance\_number/512)

H512 = 1...0…

1 - for used insurance, 0 - free
